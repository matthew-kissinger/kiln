 * A recorded poster claims this image was rendered from this source. Both halves

 *
 * It used to be, and that single assertion is what pinned the gallery build to
 * `windows-2022`. A GLB's bytes are not a property of the asset: they carry the
 * serializer's own choices, and rebuilding the same source elsewhere reproduces
 * the geometry exactly while the container can differ. Two causes were found.
 * `asset.generator` wrote the serializer's version number into every artifact,
 * which `src/render.ts` now pins to a stable string -- that one is fixed at the
 * source, and with it pinned all 86 examples are byte-identical across
 * `@gltf-transform` 4.4.1 and 4.5.0. The Linux/Windows divergence is a separate
 * cause and is not fixed, which is why this is a narrowing and not a re-record.
 *
 * So `artifactHash` in a receipt names the bytes the poster was rendered FROM, on
 * the machine that recorded it, and stays in the record as provenance. Asserting
 * it against a rebuild claimed something the format never promised.
