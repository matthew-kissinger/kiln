# render-service

GLB bytes in, PBR PNG views out. Headless three.js `WebGPURenderer` on Dawn (the `webgpu` npm
prebuilt) -- no browser, no X server, no engine coupling. This is the **GPU** in Kiln's
`--render gpu` and `--render-port`.

It runs in a separate Node process: headless WebGPU uses Node loader hooks, and a socket lets local
and remote clients share the same renderer protocol. Renderer source is included with Kiln, and
the root package declares its native GPU dependency as optional. The manifest in this directory
also supports standalone/container development; normal Kiln setup uses the root dependencies.

## Run it

Keep optional dependencies enabled when installing Kiln. In a source checkout, run
`bun install --frozen-lockfile` from the repository root. `kiln service status` checks
dependency readiness and any existing listener. CLI/MCP start a shared managed service
on demand. To run one manually from the Kiln installation root:

```bash
node --import ./render-service/src/register-hooks.mjs render-service/src/server.mjs
```

It listens on `127.0.0.1:8000`, which is where `kiln --render auto` looks. Nothing else to
configure, and nothing off this machine can reach it:

```bash
bun run kiln render examples/well.kiln.js --views sheet.png
#   sheet.png  (GPU dawn-d3d12:nvidia-geforce-rtx-3070:D3D12 driver version 32.0.16.1074)
```

Set `PORT` to move it. Point the engine at a non-default location with `--render-port <url>` or
`KILN_RENDER_PORT_URL`.

If the service requires authentication, set the client's `KILN_RENDER_TOKEN` to
the same value as the renderer's `RENDER_SERVICE_TOKEN`. Local clients can also
inherit `RENDER_SERVICE_TOKEN`; that local fallback is not sent to an explicit
remote URL. `kiln service status` reports whether authentication is required and
whether a client token is configured. Public health does not verify that token.
A missing token is reported before uploading an asset; a rejected token reports
HTTP 401 with setup guidance. Do not stop a shared renderer to bypass its access policy.

**To serve other machines, say so and bring a token.** `HOST` widens the bind, and a bind wider
than loopback requires `RENDER_SERVICE_TOKEN` -- without one the process refuses to start rather
than warning:

```bash
HOST=0.0.0.0 RENDER_SERVICE_TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 32) npm start
```

`POST /render` takes a 48 MB GLB and renders it on the GPU one frame at a time, so an exposed bind
with no auth hands any caller on that network both your GPU and a binary-asset parser. If something
in front of this process already authenticates for it -- a reverse proxy, a private container
network -- `RENDER_SERVICE_ALLOW_UNAUTHENTICATED=1` waives the requirement explicitly. The
container image sets `HOST=0.0.0.0` itself, because a container that binds loopback is unreachable
through `-p`.

**The process refuses to boot on a software adapter.** A driver regression gives you a service that
will not start, never one that quietly renders on CPU while reporting success.

## Contract

| Route | Body | Returns |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /health` | -- | `{ok, rendererId, backend, adapter, capabilities, authRequired, presentationProfile, lightingPresetIds, instance}` |
| `POST /render` (legacy) | `{glb_base64, size?=384, views?, beauty_size?, backdrop?}` | `{ok, rendererId, presentationProfile, timings, views[base64 png], beauty?}` |
| `POST /render` (camera) | `{glb_base64, cameras, width, height, lighting_preset_id?, backdrop?}` | the above plus `{backend, cameras, width, height, lightingPresetId, viewSha256, outputSetSha256, cameraReceipts}` |
| `POST /bake` | -- | 501 |

`instance` is `{version, pid, ownerPid, startedAt, sourceDir, sourceFingerprint, mode, idleTimeoutMs}`.
The initiating `ownerPid` records provenance only; its exit does not stop a shared renderer.
A managed service exits after its idle timeout, with admitted uploads, queued jobs and active
renders preventing idle shutdown. A manual service stays running until explicitly stopped.
Local clients can restart an absent service when automatic startup is enabled, including clients
that joined it before it exited. A different or incompatible listener is never replaced automatically.
`sourceFingerprint` hashes `src/` and nothing else,
so `npm install` does not change it and an edit does.

## Deploy it with the engine

The engine and this service are one contract and ship from one commit. The engine sends every field
it knows -- `backdrop`, `input_glb_sha256`, exact cameras -- and a service built before a field
existed rejects the request with a 400, which the engine reports as a CPU degrade with the status in
`degradeReason`. An incompatible local listener is reported and left running; use `kiln service stop`
explicitly once its clients are finished. Remote services are managed on their own device. When you update the engine
behind `--render-port` or `KILN_RENDER_PORT_URL`, redeploy the service from the same commit, and
compare `/health.instance.sourceFingerprint` against `bun run kiln service status` on a checkout of
that commit if you need to prove which build is live.

Auth, when `RENDER_SERVICE_TOKEN` is set, is the `x-render-token` header -- **not** `Authorization`,
because serverless edge gateways routinely consume that one before it reaches the process.

`views` is an optional array of `[x,y,z]` camera directions (max 12); the default is the six-view set
matching the engine's grid conventions. A request for N views returns exactly N PNGs in request
order -- truncating or padding would silently reshape a grid whose geometry was chosen from that
length, so an over-long list is rejected rather than trimmed.

Renders serialize through a single GPU queue. `rendererId` (e.g.
`dawn-vulkan:nvidia-rtx-a4500:NVIDIA: 550.100`) is honest producer identity and must accompany any
downstream use of the output.

Camera mode is additive and exact: 1-12 perspective cameras with `position`, `target`, `up`,
`fovDeg`, `aspect`, `near`, `far`. Integer `width`/`height` are required, bounded 1-4096, capped at
16,777,216 total pixels, and every camera aspect must equal `width / height`. It is mutually
exclusive with `views`, `size`, and `beauty_size`. The only lighting identity is `neutral-studio-v1`;
`/health.lightingPresetIds` advertises the registry.

`backdrop` names one of `neutral`, `dark` or `light` from `src/backdrops.mjs`, the same table the
engine's CPU rasterizer paints from, and is accepted in both modes; omitted means `neutral`. The
backdrop is cleared into the HDR framebuffer and tone-mapped with the asset, so the service sets it
as the linear colour that comes out of the output pass as exactly the table's bytes
(`src/display-transform.mjs`), and a GPU sheet and a CPU sheet agree pixel for pixel on it. The old
free-hex `background` field is rejected in both modes: a colour the engine would not also paint
breaks the agreement the named table exists for.

## Docker

```bash
docker build -t kiln-render-service .
docker run --gpus all -p 8000:8000 kiln-render-service
```

The image installs `libglvnd0 libegl1 libgl1 libglx0` deliberately: without the GLVND dispatch libs
an injected NVIDIA Vulkan ICD init-fails with a NULL `vkCreateInstance` and Dawn lands on a software
renderer. `NVIDIA_DRIVER_CAPABILITIES` must include `graphics` -- the commonly-copied
`utility,compute` yields no ICD and a silent software fallback.

## Tests

```bash
npm test     # contract, material fixture, presentation presets
npm run smoke # end-to-end against a real adapter
```

These are `node:test` and are not part of the engine's `bun test` suite.
