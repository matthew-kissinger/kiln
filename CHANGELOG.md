# Changelog

Changes to `@kiln/engine`. Source and installable packages are distributed through
GitHub. The package is not published on the npm registry.

## Asset links now say how big they are and who they are for — 2026-09-12

- A user reported "massive token usage" from VS Code Copilot, attributing it to
  `resource_link` mishandling. Measuring first: `kiln_save`/`kiln_export` put **941 B of
  URIs** on the wire and no file bytes, and a JSON-RPC tap showed the Copilot **CLI**
  never calls `resources/read` at all. So the stated mechanism does not exist in our
  responses — but the report was standing next to something real.
- Kiln emitted only four of `ResourceLink`'s fields. The spec also carries **`size`** and
  **`annotations.audience`**, which are exactly how a server tells a client "this artifact
  is for the human to download, not for the model to read". Emitting neither left every
  client guessing from a MIME type, including the ones that guess "inline everything".
  Both are now set, with `priority`: `asset.glb` and `preview.png` are `['user']` because
  the model already receives rendered views as image blocks and geometry as metrics;
  `source.kiln.js` is addressed to both.
- `editable.zip` is no longer advertised. It is a bundle of the files listed beside it, so
  a client resolving every link paid for the same bytes twice — and it was the largest
  entry while being the only derived one. It stays readable at its URI (which is what the
  widget's download button uses) and stays in `downloadUrls`.
- Net wire cost went **941 B → 1,017 B**. This is not a size win and is not claimed as
  one: it trades 76 bytes for every client being *able* to decide correctly. The `size` is
  compared in the test against the bytes `resources/read` actually returns for that URI,
  because a declared size a client cannot trust is worse than no size at all.

## Post-release polish: the install guide had gone stale — 2026-09-12

- `docs/install.md` told readers to use a checkout **"until an updated package is
  released"**, naming `kiln-engine-0.6.0.tgz`, an eight-tool surface, and five tools the
  package lacked. All three were true when written and none survived `v0.7.0`. Verified by
  driving the published tarball's MCP server over stdio: it advertises **13 tools**,
  including all five that section said were missing.
- Rewritten to link the latest release and the generated tool reference instead of
  restating either. The section was fragile because it duplicated facts that live in gated
  files — `docs/tools.md` is already checked against the registry, so it does not need
  repeating in prose that nothing checks.
- A test now enforces the rule that follows: install guidance may not hard-code a release
  tarball version, and must point at `releases/latest` and `tools.md`. Scoped to the docs
  that tell a reader how to *obtain* the package; `CONTRIBUTING.md` keeps its
  `kiln-engine-0.6.0.tgz` because there the filename is the evidence for why the version
  policy exists. Both failure modes verified — a pinned version, and a link that stops
  pointing at the latest release.
- `docs/migration.md` said "keeps the package version at `0.6.0` until release review",
  which stopped being true at the tag.
- **AGENTS.md now explains the two tool surfaces**, which was a real comprehension trap:
  `registry.ts` holds the in-process loop's four tools and the MCP surface's thirteen, and
  "both skins consume it" read as one shared list. The one differing name,
  `kiln_screenshot`, is **merged rather than missing** — in-process, `kiln_render` returns
  metrics only and `kiln_screenshot` carries the six-view grid, so a cheap structural check
  need not pay for an image; on MCP, `kiln_render` is unified and returns metrics, part
  paths and images together, so a separate screenshot tool would be a second way to ask for
  the same grid.
- Also measured while checking the new-developer path, in a fresh clone: **~31 seconds from
  nothing to a rendered GLB** (4s clone, 26s install, 1s render), and the documented
  render-service step works verbatim — `npm --prefix render-service ci --ignore-scripts` in
  2s, then 37 tests pass.

## The Windows failure was a real bug in the alias lock — 2026-09-12

- `rejects lost updates from eight independent processes` went red once on a Windows
  runner. The first read of it here was wrong, and the number that refutes it was in the
  log all along: **the test failed in 123 ms**, while both hang guards are 10 and 15
  seconds away. Nothing was slow. A worker died, fast.
- The only way `compareAndSet` does that is the `throw error` beside its lock, reached
  whenever `mkdir` reports contention with a code other than `EEXIST`. **Windows has
  exactly that case**: directory deletion is not synchronous, so a directory whose last
  handle has not closed sits in pending-delete, where `mkdir` on that name answers `EPERM`
  or `EACCES`. Every release runs `rmdir` in a `finally`, so with eight processes
  contending, one landing in that window is ordinary contention — and it was rethrown.
- `isLockContention` now recognises those two codes **on Windows only**. Widening it to
  every platform would be the over-fix: on POSIX, `EPERM`/`EACCES` from `mkdir` means the
  parent directory is not writable, and swallowing that would report a permission fault as
  "busy". Both mistakes are pinned by tests — reverting to `EEXIST`-only fails the Windows
  case, over-widening fails the POSIX guard.
- Lock release stopped being able to decide the call's outcome. `rmdir` has no `force`, and
  on Windows it can fail while a scanner holds the directory — which inside a `finally`
  would replace a precise `Alias conflict` with an unrelated errno, or turn a successful
  write into a failure. Cleanup failures are now swallowed, and a lingering lock degrades
  to "busy" rather than corrupting anything.
- Asserted on the decision rather than through a real Windows filesystem, so a Linux host
  checks every branch and the platform is a parameter. The worker timings added alongside
  are what made the failure legible in the first place, and they stay: one `FAILED` beside
  seven fast children points at the code, where all eight slow points at the host.

## `--receipt` was relative to the wrong directory — 2026-09-12

- `scripts/verify-package-receipt.mjs` resolved `--receipt` against `--root` rather than the
  working directory. Those are **the same directory in the CI step**, which is why the
  original passed its own tests and every CI run — and different everywhere else.
- Found by using it. Assembling the release from downloaded artifacts puts the receipts in
  a staging directory while `root` is the repository, so every path silently became
  `<repo>/linux-package.json` and all four verifications failed with `ENOENT`. The
  assembly refused to publish, which is what it is for.
- A path a person types on a command line belongs to where they typed it. `root` now
  locates `package.json` and nothing else.
- The test that passed while the bug existed is the finding worth keeping: its fixture had
  `root` and the receipt in the same temp directory, mirroring the CI step, so it could not
  tell the two rules apart. It now addresses the receipt explicitly and a second case pins
  the resolution rule with `root` and the receipt in *different* directories. Both fail if
  the old behaviour is reintroduced — the doubled path in the error is its signature.

## webgpu 0.6.1 is held out of 0.7.0 — 2026-09-12

- The bump was slated for this release and then held, because reading what is in it
  changed the decision. `webgpu@0.6.1` was published **the same day**, and
  `v0.6.0...v0.6.1` bumps the `third_party/dawn` submodule to "latest" alongside a real
  fix — unmapping a device's buffers when the device is destroyed, with 114 lines of new
  tests upstream.
- The fix is worth having: render-service creates and destroys a device per capture, and
  buffer unmapping on destroy is the readback path. That is not what holds it.
- What holds it is that **nothing here can exercise it.** CI installs render-service with
  `--ignore-scripts` so the 37 pure tests run without a device — which means they prove
  the package resolves and nothing more. `render-service/src/`, `package.json` and
  `package-lock.json` all ship inside the engine tarball, so an untested native bump would
  be in the release artifact, attested by four receipts that never touched a GPU.
- So 0.7.0 ships from what CI has fully proven, and this is the first change after it,
  gated on the GPU smoke that already holds Phase 4 §7 and the two conformance runs.
- Noted while looking, not changed: `render-service/package.json` has an `allowScripts`
  field keyed `{"webgpu@0.6.0": true}` that **nothing reads** — not Bun's
  `trustedDependencies`, no `@lavamoat/allow-scripts` in the tree, and the README says
  plain `npm install`, which runs scripts anyway. It looks like a control over native
  build execution and is not one. Left for a deliberate decision rather than deleted.

## All four platform receipts come from CI now — 2026-09-12

- The 2026-09-05 release attached `linux-package.json` and `windows-package.json`, but
  `test:package` ran only in the macOS job — so two of the four platforms a release
  attests to had **no reproducible source** and were produced by hand. `linux-package`
  and `windows-package` jobs close that; CI now emits the tarball and all four receipts
  from one run.
- The receipt check left the workflow. It was a ~400-character `node -e` one-liner inside
  the macOS job, which is tolerable at one platform and not at four: the expected platform
  differs per job, so copying it is three chances to assert `darwin` on a Linux runner and
  have the receipt pass anyway. **A receipt that cannot fail is not evidence.** It is now
  `scripts/verify-package-receipt.mjs`, one line in each of the four jobs.
- Extracting it bought two things beyond deduplication. Expected Node and npm versions
  come from `engines` rather than being written a second time, so `check-toolchain.mjs`
  stays the single source; and because the receipt records `engineVersion`, each platform
  receipt is now checked against `package.json` — so a release's receipts are tied to its
  version rather than merely sitting beside it.
- `--tarball` overrides the path the receipt recorded, which is what makes one verifier
  serve both uses. In the job the receipt names a tarball sitting right there. At
  release-assembly time the receipts are downloaded artifacts whose absolute paths belong
  to a runner that no longer exists — but their `tarballSha256` is exactly what must be
  checked against the file about to be published.
- Verified against a real receipt rather than only fixtures: the Linux smoke was run on a
  Linux host first (16 checks, `engineVersion 0.7.0`), then that receipt was accepted,
  **rejected when asked to assert `darwin`** — the precise bug copying the one-liner would
  have caused — and rejected again after one byte was appended to the tarball, naming both
  hashes.
- `REQUIRED_CHECKS` goes to eight, and the gate added two changes ago is what forced that
  edit: adding a job without deciding whether it gates a merge fails the suite. First time
  one of this phase's gates caught the next change instead of a past one.

## 0.7.0 — the version moves with what ships — 2026-09-12

- `version` sat at `0.6.0` from the OSS release through **21 shipped changes**, while CI
  named every tarball from it. Two people could hold `kiln-engine-0.6.0.tgz` and have
  materially different software — across a three.js major, a history rewrite and a `dist/`
  re-add. It moves per shipped change now: patch for a fix, minor for changed or added
  capability, which is the normal case pre-1.0.
- **0.7.0 rather than a patch.** What accumulated is behaviour: three.js r186, the
  CommonJS removal it exposed, 128 lines of previously understated tool schema in
  `docs/tools.md`, and a `shadows.type` contract that now selects a filter from
  `basic`/`pcf`/`vsm` instead of naming one that no longer exists.
- A bump has to be rebuilt, because `runtimeBuildIdentity` hashes the version into each
  entry's `identity` in `dist/build.json` — the value a build receipt cites. A test now
  asserts `package.json` and every `dist/build.json` entry agree.
- **Nothing caught that drift before, and this was verified rather than assumed.** With
  the version at 0.7.0 and `dist/` still recording 0.6.0, the full suite passed — 1860
  tests, zero failures. `mcp-bundle.test.ts` rebuilds `dist/mcp-server.mjs` and compares
  bytes, but the version is read from `package.json` at runtime rather than inlined, so
  the bytes are identical and the stale record is invisible to it. Confirmed by the
  rebuild: `dist/build.json` was the only file that changed.

## The documented offline gate did not run two of the repository's checks — 2026-09-12

- `bun run test` is `bun test src scripts`, so it never reached `render-service/`. Its 37
  tests ran only in CI, in the job 13.7 added — so a contributor editing that subsystem
  got **no local signal at all** and found out from a red pull request. `check:skills`
  was the same shape in the other direction: a step in CI's `checks` job that the
  documented gate never named.
- The subsystem cannot fold into `bun test src scripts`: it is a separate npm project
  with its own lockfile and a native dependency. It gets `bun run test:render-service`
  instead, which needs `npm --prefix render-service ci --ignore-scripts` once. All 37
  tests are pure — framing arithmetic, PNG readback packing, cache identity, contract and
  preset validation — so none needs a GPU or the Dawn build, which is the CI job's own
  recorded reason `--ignore-scripts` suffices.
- Both are now in the gate in `AGENTS.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and a test asserts the
  general defect rather than the instance: **every `bun run` command the agent guide
  names must exist as a script**, and the two that were missing must appear in the gate
  block itself.
- Reading the fenced block rather than the whole file is what makes that discriminate.
  The first version checked "named anywhere in `AGENTS.md`" and stayed green when the
  line was deleted from the gate — because the prose underneath mentions the same
  command. Verified three ways after narrowing: a guide naming a script that does not
  exist, the line dropped from the block, and the script removed from `package.json` all
  fail.

## Three CI jobs reported and blocked nothing — 2026-09-12

- `build portable Node package` and both `Node package · macOS` jobs run on every push
  and every pull request, and were required by nothing. Measured before changing
  anything: **24 of 24 green across the last 8 runs on main**, and a pull request that
  broke macOS packaging would still have merged.
- The test named `every CI job blocks; none of them merely reports` was green throughout,
  because it checked only `continue-on-error` — the narrower of the two ways a job can
  fail to block. Its own comment already described the gap it did not cover: *"the other
  half is a GitHub setting."* For three jobs that setting had simply never been made.
- 13.4 set the precedent that a context is required only once it has reported, since a
  required context that never reports blocks every merge instead of guarding it. It
  promoted the Windows job on nine runs with seven green; these three clear that bar.
- The test now derives every context `ci.yml` can produce — expanding the macOS matrix
  into its two legs, because GitHub requires the expanded name — and compares it against
  the list that has to be required. Adding a job without deciding whether it gates a
  merge now fails the suite. Verified three ways: a new job, a renamed job, and a dropped
  matrix leg each fail, naming the exact context gained or lost.
- **`build the gallery` is deliberately not required.** `pages.yml` is path-filtered, so
  it stays silent on any pull request touching none of `examples/`, `site/`, `src/`,
  `scripts/authorship.ts` or `README.md`. Requiring it would block every such merge —
  the exact trap 13.4 named. The rule is now written down: unconditional workflow,
  required; conditional workflow, unrequired.

## The documented way to convert an old clone did not work — 2026-09-12

- The 2026-09-10 rewrite moved `refs/tags/oss-2026-09-05` as well as `main`, and a tag
  is the one ref `git fetch` will not update on its own. So the README's remedy
  — `git fetch origin && git reset --hard origin/main` — left the old tag in place,
  holding every removed file reachable. Measured on the clone this was found in:
  `.git` at 228 MB where a fresh clone is 26 MB, with identical content.
- Reproduced by running the documented commands verbatim in a throwaway copy. The two
  obvious next guesses are not merely ineffective, they are **refused**: plain
  `git fetch --tags` and even `--prune-tags` both report `would clobber existing tag`,
  so a reader has no route to the answer without already knowing `--force`.
- The instructions now force the tag and then reclaim. Verified end to end on the real
  stale clone: 228 MB to 23 MB, `fsck` clean, `HEAD` and the working tree hash
  byte-identical before and after. The plan document already recorded that "the tag was
  the whole rewrite" for the *push* side; this is the same fact on the clone side, which
  is the side a reader is on.
- `scripts/reliability.test.mjs` pins it, and asserts the **absence** of the broken form
  as well as the presence of the working one — the short version is what a later
  simplification reaches for.
- Clone figures re-measured: 60 MB full and 49 MB with `--filter=blob:none`, where the
  README said 52 MB and 48 MB. `.git` grew from 18 MB to 26 MB when the runtime bundles
  were re-added after the rewrite; the checkout is unchanged at 34 MB. The timing claims
  are removed rather than restated — they are network-bound and cannot be honestly
  re-verified from a different link.

## Skill bytes are canonical, and the SEP-2640 record is corrected — 2026-09-12

- Re-read SEP-2640 from the spec text on its PR branch and the working group's own
  repository, rather than from a page about it. Three things this project had recorded
  were wrong.
- **The design changed, and not cosmetically.** The extension defines `skills/list`,
  `skills/get`, and an optional `resources/directory/read`. **`skills/activate` is
  gone**, and with it the bundle, the scoped tools revealed on activation, and
  progressive disclosure inside the protocol. The SEP now "defines only the transport
  binding" and delegates the format and disclosure model to the Agent Skills
  specification.
- **The status heuristic was backwards.** The note here said "read the labels, not the
  prose", after a summary twice reported the SEP as Final. The SEP document's own
  `Status:` field *does* read Final; the pull request's label still reads `draft`, and
  under the SEP process the document is the status of record. The note pointed at the
  weaker signal.
- **"Nothing to build against" is no longer true.** The spec depends on nothing beyond
  base Resources, capability declaration rides SEP-2133, and the pinned
  `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk@1.30.0` already carries `extensions` in
  `ServerCapabilitiesSchema` while `setRequestHandler` takes any schema. Conformance
  tests merged 2026-09-11.
- 7.12 still waits, for a different and checkable reason: **nothing public consumes it.**
  The TypeScript SDK's convenience wrappers PR is closed unmerged, every public host is a
  prototype in one contributor's forks, Claude Code's is internal and not public, and the
  GitHub MCP server prototype is closed. Shipping it now adds a third transport no host
  can call. **Re-check the TypeScript SDK, not the SEP's status.**
- The re-read found one real gap. `skills/list` publishes a per-file `digest` and `size`
  over raw bytes, and this project already publishes sha256 digests of skill artifacts at
  `/.well-known/agent-skills/index.json` — but `skills/**` was `-text` in
  `.gitattributes` and carried the same accidental line-ending mix found in
  `render-service/src`: five files fully CRLF, two mixed, seven LF. It went unnoticed
  because the frontmatter parser is tolerant of both. Tolerant parsing is right;
  publishing a digest over whichever ending an editor happened to write is not.
- Normalized to LF across `skills/` and both registry copies, and `check:skills` now
  rejects CRLF in any skill file. Verified by reintroducing one — and then by `git
  checkout` restoring the pre-normalization bytes and the gate firing on that too, which
  is the regression path that actually happens.
- Two pieces of the eventual work are already in place: the digest derivation extends
  7.13's rather than being invented, and `check:skills` has enforced the SEP's
  name-equals-directory rule since Phase 7.

## The published tool reference is correct again — 2026-09-12

- `docs/tools.md` is generated from the tool registry, and `docs/` is in the package's
  `files` list — so a stale reference is not an internal note being wrong, it is shipped
  to every install. It was stale: regenerating moved **128 lines**.
- The cause was an in-range dependency bump. `zod` 4.4.3 → 4.6.2 changed
  `z.toJSONSchema` to emit `items: false`, `minItems` and `maxItems` for fixed-length
  tuples, so every tuple input in the published reference understated its own schema.
- Nothing caught it because the generator's `--check` mode appeared in **no workflow and
  no test** — the same shape as the render service's 37 tests running nowhere. An
  offline gate that runs nowhere is worth exactly as much as no gate.
- It is a test now rather than a workflow step: the generator exports
  `toolReferenceMarkdown()` with its CLI behaviour behind a direct-entry guard, and
  `scripts/tool-reference.test.mjs` compares the published file to the registry. `bun
  test` already runs on Linux, Windows and both macOS architectures, so this needs no
  new job — and cannot become a job somebody forgets to add, which is the failure mode
  being fixed.
- Compared whole rather than section by section: the drift that shipped was four added
  lines inside one nested schema, which any summary comparison would have missed.
  Verified by dropping a single `minItems` line and watching the test name the file and
  the command that fixes it.

## Every directory that holds code is linted now — 2026-09-12

- 14.4 left the one-off tools in `scripts/` out and priced the alternative at 26 lint
  findings, a 1,530-line reflow, and 162 lines of coverage slack. After the ratchet got
  a scope the third term is **zero** — `scripts/**` is not instrumented at all — so what
  was left was a diff, and it is taken. **480 files where 442 were.**
- Thirty-four format findings and thirty-two real ones, over `.mjs` and `.ts` alike; the
  `.ts` files under `scripts/` had never been linted either, since the pattern was
  `src/**/*.ts`.
- Twenty-five `useTemplate`, seventeen of them one idiom: `JSON.stringify(…) + '\n'`,
  the receipt-file shape, across eleven files. A shared helper is the obvious DRY move
  and is deliberately not taken — `package-plugin.mjs` ships in the package `files`
  list, so importing one means shipping another file for a cosmetic win.
- Three findings were not cosmetic. **Two `any` in the pilot evaluation host**: one read
  as `previous.config` / `previous?.deadline`, now typed; one feeding a budget estimator
  through optional chains, now a declared `PilotToolInput` that names exactly the fields
  the image-cell budget depends on — documentation the estimator did not have. A loop's
  update step hiding in its condition in `smoke-package.mjs`. And **a literal ESC byte**
  in `harness.mjs`'s ANSI stripper, invisible in every diff and editor, now `\u001B`.
- Also surfaced, and deliberately left for its own change: `docs/tools.md` is stale and
  its `docs:tools --check` drift checker runs in no workflow and no test. The cause is
  the `zod` 4.4.3 → 4.6.2 bump — `z.toJSONSchema` now emits `items: false`, `minItems`
  and `maxItems` for fixed-length tuples — so the published tool reference has
  understated every tuple schema since. Ledger 14.8.

## render-service joins the lint surface — 2026-09-12

- It was left out because `render-service/src/**` is `-text` in `.gitattributes` and the
  formatter would rewrite the line endings. Looking at what the attribute protected
  turned that reason into the finding.
- **It was sweeping, not deliberate.** The line arrived in the OSS release commit
  alongside the other `-text` entries, and what it froze is inconsistent: four files
  fully CRLF, `renderer.mjs` at 395 of 399 lines, three carrying a single stray CRLF
  line, four fully LF. One stray CRLF line in an otherwise-LF file is an editor's
  signature, not a decision.
- **Those bytes are genuinely hashed**, so the replacement matters:
  `fingerprintRendererInputs` walks that directory into the renderer's capture identity.
  But `-text` only guarantees "whatever was committed", while the `* text=auto eol=lf`
  rule guarantees what the fingerprint needs — one line ending on every platform. The
  normalization is a stricter guarantee than the attribute it replaces.
- **Nothing re-validates the old digest.** `capture-producer.v1` fingerprints in
  checked-in provenance receipts record the renderer build a poster was made under; no
  test recomputes one. 13.6 already edited two of these files and every gate stayed
  green — a later build hashing differently is the point of recording it.
- Eight files to LF, the attribute removed with the reasoning left where the next reader
  will ask, and the directory linted: **442 files where 416 were.** Twenty-two format
  findings, then five real ones. One of them, `useIterableCallbackReturn` in
  `presentation-presets.mjs`, is the same defect 13.5 fixed in the Bradley-Terry fit —
  a one-expression arrow in a `forEach` returning a value the contract discards — sitting
  in production render-service code that was outside every lint gate this repo has.
- `reliability.test.mjs` pins both include patterns and asserts the `-text` line stays
  gone. render-service's own 37 tests pass on the normalized sources.

## The coverage ratchet has a scope now — 2026-09-12

- The previous entry blamed 162 lines of lost coverage slack on helper scripts being
  measured and never executed. The number was right; the mechanism was wrong. Bun
  instruments only files it loads, and `coveragePathIgnorePatterns` already dropped
  `**/*.test.mjs`, so those tools were never in the report — there is no `SF:` record
  for `dispatch-asset`, `upload-posters`, `geometry-experiments` or `harness`.
- Exactly **four** files under `scripts/` were instrumented, because tests import them:
  `evaluation/observe-shipping.mjs`, `build-runtime.mjs`, `evaluation/conditions.ts` and
  `authorship.ts`. 229 lines against the engine's 45,726 — 0.5% of the denominator, and
  worth 0.10 points. Two of the four are dense single-expression files, so reflowing
  them inflated their line counts while their covered lines stayed put. That is where
  the 162 lines went.
- So the finding is narrower and worse than "helper scripts dilute the ratchet": the
  engine's coverage contract had a **repo-only formatting input**. A number this
  repository enforces as policy could be moved by reformatting code that does not ship.
- `bunfig.toml` now ignores `scripts/**` for coverage. Those tests still run — they are
  the gates — but their sources leave the denominator, so the ratchet is a statement
  about the shipped engine and nothing else. Re-measured on the narrowed scope: **95.39%
  functions, 92.59% lines**.
- Narrowing hands back 44 lines of slack no new test earned, so `lines` goes 92 → **92.1**
  to hold the 224-line margin 13.3 chose rather than pocket it. `functions` stays at 94,
  where the margin is unchanged in practice. Tightening further is a separate decision.
- And the record carries its own scope now. `measuredBaseline` requires `measuredOver`,
  the gate refuses a baseline without it, and it prints it: `Recorded baseline:
  functions 95.39%, lines 92.59% (over src/, bun@1.4.2, 2026-09-12)`. A percentage
  without its scope is as ambiguous as a threshold without a baseline — which is what
  made the wrong explanation above plausible enough to write down.

## The repository's own gates are linted now — 2026-09-12

- Adding a file to `scripts/` and running `biome check` on its path printed "No files
  were processed." Biome's `files.includes` was `src/`, `site/src/` and `site/*.ts`, so
  the directory holding this repository's gates — and which `test:coverage` already
  measures — sat outside the lint surface. The zero-warning baseline 13.5 established
  was zero across a subset.
- Taken: `scripts/check-*.mjs` and `scripts/**/*.test.mjs` — the checks are now checked.
  416 files where 405 were. Ten findings were behind the hole: seven format, and three
  real ones. A dead `const` in `check-vision.mjs`, easy to miss because the identical
  line two loops down is load-bearing. Two `useTemplate` on the
  `JSON.stringify(…) + '\n'` idiom. `reliability.test.mjs` asserts both include
  patterns, verified by dropping one and watching it fail.
- Left, with the cost measured rather than guessed. The rest of `scripts/` is one-off
  tools, several authored as dense single-expression lines. Taking the whole directory
  is 26 lint findings, a 1,530-line reflow (3,078 lines to 4,608, pure formatting), and
  **162 lines of coverage slack** — lines fall 92.49% to 92.14% against a threshold of
  92. Measured by taking the full pass and running the gate.
- **Corrected below**: the mechanism first given for that third cost was wrong, and it
  pointed at the wrong fix.
- `render-service/` stays out for an unrelated reason: its sources are CRLF by
  `.gitattributes`, and the formatter would rewrite the line endings.
- One incidental finding: Biome prints at most 20 diagnostics by default, so a count
  read off `bun run lint` is a floor, not a total. The gate still fails either way.

## The prompt-cache breakpoint is asserted on the wire — 2026-09-12

- The two deferred rows in the queue were both deferred *with a reason*. Checking the
  reasons rather than inheriting them changed both answers.
- **The `ai` 7 family is blocked upstream, and money was never the constraint.** The
  recorded reason was that only `test:live` exercises those paths and it spends money.
  What actually blocks it: `@strands-agents/sdk@1.17.0` is the latest release, declares
  peer `@ai-sdk/provider: ^3.0.0`, and types its `VercelModel` on `LanguageModelV3`,
  while `@openrouter/ai-sdk-provider@3` requires `ai@^7`, which depends on
  `@ai-sdk/provider@4`. No budget moves that.
- And `typecheck` would not have caught it. `@ai-sdk/provider@4` still exports
  `LanguageModelV3` beside V4, so the import keeps compiling; the break is a v4 model
  handed to a v3 wrapper, at runtime, on the one path no offline suite drives. There is
  a gate for it now: `scripts/peer-ranges.test.mjs` walks the installed tree and fails
  on a peer range the version beside it does not meet.
- **It found a mismatch that already exists.** `@strands-agents/sdk` declares peer
  `@anthropic-ai/sdk: ^0.109.1` — on a 0.x version that means `>=0.109.1 <0.110.0` —
  and the last dependency refresh took 0.125.0. Fifteen minors past the declared
  range, moved by a routine in-range update, noticed by nothing. Kept, and listed with
  its reasoning in the gate's `ACCEPTED` table, so the next one fails while this one is
  a decision on the record rather than a silence.
- **The native cache breakpoint is now asserted against the bytes.** The OpenRouter
  half already was: it drives `doStream` with `fetch` replaced and reads the outgoing
  JSON. The native half asserted that `toCachedSystemPrompt` returns
  `[TextBlock, CachePointBlock]` — the input to the transport, never its output. So the
  claim the design rests on, that a cache point becomes `cache_control` on the wire,
  was carried by a comment, on two dependencies that move inside their caret ranges on
  every refresh. Losing it bills full price for every prefix that should have been a
  cache read, with every offline gate green.
- Both native transports are captured now, offline: the Anthropic client takes a
  `fetch` that records and throws, Bedrock a `requestHandler` that does the same. Both
  tests are differential — a plain string goes out with no breakpoint — so the
  breakpoint has one possible origin. Establishing that took an injected defect, which
  disproved the first draft's premise: Bedrock does *not* auto-inject a system cache
  point here, because that needs a `cacheConfig` and Kiln passes none. Patching the
  installed adapters to drop `cache_control` and the converse `cachePoint` fails
  exactly the new tests while every pre-existing test stays green — including the one
  named "the adapter emits `cache_control`", which never checked that it did.
- **7.12 / SEP-2640 stays deferred, for a better reason.** PR 2640 is open and still
  labelled `draft`; a page summary reported it Final for the second time and was wrong
  again. But the row turns on something downstream: `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`
  publishes 1.30.0 as latest, the version already installed, so there is no TypeScript
  surface for `skill://` resources to build against whatever the SEP does next. Check
  the SDK's version, not the pull request.

## A preset's shadow filter now selects a filter — 2026-09-12

- Going to compare shadow filters by eye turned up the reason there was nothing to
  compare: **no shipped presentation preset enables shadows.** `neutral-studio-v1` sets
  `shadows.enabled: false` to preserve the pre-registry visual, `gallery-studio-v1` is a
  spread of it, and every light has `castsShadow: false`. So r186 deleting the PCFSoft
  implementation is not a visible regression here, and yesterday's switch to
  `PCFShadowMap` corrected a line that never runs. Its claim to keep the log clean was
  overstated: the assignment sits inside `if (preset.shadows.enabled)`, so three's
  deprecation warning never fired from this service either.
- What was actually wrong is that `shadows.type` described a filter and selected nothing.
  The validator demanded the exact string `pcf-soft` while the renderer ignored the field
  and hardcoded a constant — and after r186, the one name the schema accepted was the one
  name that no longer exists.
- It selects a filter now. `SHADOW_FILTERS` is `basic`, `pcf`, `vsm` — what r186 left —
  and the renderer maps each to its three constant. `vsm` is the soft option that
  survives, with one catch recorded where someone choosing it will read it: under VSM
  every shadow receiver also casts, so a ground plane starts casting too.
- The names live in the schema that validates them and the constants live in the module
  that imports three, so the renderer checks at load that the map covers the list. A name
  the validator accepts and the map lacks would set `shadowMap.type` to `undefined` mid
  render — not a crash, just a quietly different image. Verified by adding `pcf-soft` back
  to the list and watching the service refuse to start.
- The gallery is not affected either, for a different reason: neither `<Canvas>` in the
  site sets r3f's `shadows` prop, so `renderer.shadowMap.enabled` stays false there too,
  and the only shadowing on that surface is drei's `ContactShadows` — its own depth pass to
  a texture, which never consults `shadowMap.type`. Between the two paths, r186's PCFSoft
  removal changes nothing anyone can see in this repository.
- **`render-service` is in CI now**, which it never was. Thirty-seven tests guarding a
  shipped subsystem ran on nobody's machine but a maintainer's — including, until this
  commit, the change above it. It is a separate npm project with a native dependency,
  which is presumably the reason; but the tests do not need it. All 37 are pure: framing
  arithmetic, PNG readback packing, cache identity, contract and preset validation, and
  not one acquires a device. So the job installs with `--ignore-scripts`, skipping the
  `webgpu` package's Dawn build. Verified against exactly that install with no binding
  built: 37 pass, 0 fail. The GPU smoke and the two conformance runs stay manual, because
  those genuinely need a device.

## The lint baseline is zero, and stays zero — 2026-09-12

- `bun run lint` reported **14 warnings and 11 infos** and exited 0. All 25 are fixed;
  the tree now reports nothing. The point is not tidiness: a baseline everyone agrees to
  ignore is a baseline the twenty-sixth finding arrives invisible against.
- Two of them were not style. `isFinite` in the render inspector is the coercing global,
  where `Number.isFinite` is not — identical on a `Box3` component, taken because the next
  caller to pass something looser is the one the coercion silently accepts. And
  `ids.forEach((id, i) => index.set(id, i))` in the Bradley-Terry fit returned the map
  from a callback whose contract discards it; the index is built from its pairs instead.
- Three `any` bounds in `buildSandboxGlobals` carried
  `// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any`. This repository lints
  with Biome and has no ESLint config, so those suppressed nothing while reading as
  reviewed-and-accepted. Rather than translate them, the `any` is gone: `never[]` is the
  correct bound for "any parameter list" and `unknown` for "any return", with one narrow
  assertion where tsc resolves a call through the constraint and can only see `unknown`.
- The quaternion fixture's `0.7071` is now `Math.SQRT1_2` — exact, and it says which angle
  a quarter turn about Y actually is.
- **Warnings now fail.** `lint` runs with `--error-on-warnings`, and because that flag
  does not reach Biome's info severity — where `useTemplate` and several others sit by
  default — the seven rules this cleanup touched carry an explicit `error` in
  `biome.json`. Each of the seven was verified by reintroducing its defect and confirming
  the gate fails and names the rule.
- The `useIterableCallbackReturn: "warn"` downgrade is gone with the finding it was
  written around. A test asserts the seven severities and the `lint` script itself: a rule
  lowered to keep a build green is indistinguishable from a rule nobody wanted, and that
  has happened here before.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` says the contract plainly — the tree reports nothing, so any
  diagnostic a change produces belongs to that change, to fix or to suppress with a
  `biome-ignore` comment that says why.

## The gates stop reporting and start blocking — 2026-09-12

- **The Windows job blocks.** It landed reporting-only on purpose, because the fault it
  was added to rule out — a native GLib `g_system_thread_free` / invalid `CloseHandle`
  inside libvips/sharp under Bun's threading — was intermittent, and a required check
  that fails at random is worse than no check. Its whole history is now nine runs: seven
  green, two red, and not one recurrence. Both reds were new code from the session that
  added the job — a `require('sharp/package.json')` that sharp's `exports` map blocks,
  and a `new URL('..', import.meta.url).pathname` that yields `/D:/a/kiln/src/` — and
  neither is reachable from a POSIX host. The failures were true, which is the argument
  for blocking rather than against it.
- Blocking means a hang is a blocked merge rather than a slow report, so the job now has
  a 30-minute bound. The suite runs there in about two minutes.
- A test asserts no CI job carries `continue-on-error` at job level, so this cannot be
  demoted by one line slipping back in. The single step-level exception is the native
  dependency inventory, which exists to attach libvips and GLib versions to a run if the
  fault ever returns and must never be why Windows reports red. Indentation is the
  distinction and the test reads it as such.
- **The coverage ratchet moves to 94% functions / 92% lines**, from 92/91. Measured
  95.27% and 92.49% on this tree, which leaves 42 functions and 224 lines of room.
- That "42 functions" is the other half of the change: the gate now reports its margin
  in the unit a person can act on. A percentage says whether the gate passed; turning it
  into work needs LCOV totals that are not in front of whoever tripped it. Slack rounds
  down and a shortfall rounds up, so neither reads as more comfortable than it is.
- The gate also refuses a threshold set above the baseline it records. That is the one
  mistake the coverage comparison cannot catch by itself: a threshold above anything
  ever measured fails in whatever change happens to run next, and reads there as that
  change's regression. A thresholds file with no recorded baseline is refused for the
  same reason — a ratchet is raised to a number somebody measured.

## Dependencies current in range, and the toolchain gate gets its own test — 2026-09-12

- In-range refresh, deliberately kept apart from the deferred majors: `ai` 6.0.222 →
  6.0.282, `openai` 6.46.0 → 6.49.0, `@ai-sdk/provider` 3.0.14 → 3.0.16,
  `@aws-sdk/client-bedrock-runtime` 3.1083.0 → 3.1131.0, and in `site/` react and
  react-dom 19.2.8 → 19.3.0 with their types, plus vite 8.2.2 → 8.3.0.
- The `ai` 7 / `@ai-sdk/provider` 4 / `@openrouter/ai-sdk-provider` 3 family stays
  where it was. Only `test:live` exercises those paths and it spends money, and the
  deliberate prompt-cache transport asymmetry is exactly what a provider major breaks
  without a test noticing. Nothing enforces that decision in prose and nothing needs
  to: the caret ranges cannot resolve to a new major, so the boundary is structural.
- The `@types/three` parity rule added yesterday now reads as what it always was — a
  rule about types, not about three. Every `@types/*` whose runtime package the same
  manifest pins must sit on that runtime's release line. That is what brought
  `@types/react` and `@types/react-dom` along with react 19.3: the site compiles its
  `@react-three/fiber` JSX against those types, and types a release line behind make
  new API invisible to `tsc` while removed API still typechecks.
- **`check-toolchain.mjs` now has a test.** It had grown three times, each extension
  verified by injecting the defect by hand, once, at the time — the right check made in
  the wrong place, because nothing stopped a later edit from leaving a rule that could
  no longer fail. A vacuous gate is worse than no gate, since it is believed. The gate
  takes an optional `--root`, and each case stages a real copy of the repository's own
  files, mutates exactly one value, and asserts the gate names it: stale engine pin,
  prose that installs the wrong Bun, three drifting in either the site or the render
  service, types off their runtime's line, an Action pinned to a mutable tag, and a
  Pages workflow left behind. Staging the real files rather than a synthetic fixture is
  the point: a rule whose phrasing drifts out of step with the document it reads fails
  the baseline case immediately.
- A mutation that changes nothing fails the test. A search string that no longer
  appears injects no defect, the gate correctly reports a clean tree, and the case goes
  green having checked nothing — the exact rot the file exists to prevent, so it is
  caught rather than trusted.

## The r186 bump missed the site, and now a gate catches that — 2026-09-12

- `site/` was still on three 0.185.1 while the engine and `render-service` moved to
  0.186.0. Substantive rather than untidy: kiln emits `EXT_mesh_gpu_instancing`, and
  r186 fixed that extension's custom instance attribute sharing in `GLTFLoader`, so
  the site was rendering the gallery with an unfixed loader for an extension the
  engine writes.
- `check:toolchain` now asserts `three` is byte-identical in every manifest that pins
  it, and that `@types/three` tracks its minor. Verified by injecting three defects —
  the exact drift that shipped, a `render-service` drift, and a stale `@types/three` —
  and confirming each is caught and names the offending manifest.
- The reason this is a gate and not a note: the same class of defect, a value that
  must agree across files with nothing enforcing it, had been caught in the prose that
  same morning by a person. Twice in one day is an argument for a check.

## Finishing the CommonJS removal the r186 bump started — 2026-09-12

- The previous entry's fix was incomplete, and looked complete.
  `src/ops.ts` moved to the ESM build, but `src/__tests__/subdivide-normals.test.ts`
  still imported the bare specifier — so the CommonJS build kept loading and kept
  emitting `THREE_CJS_DEPRECATED`, while the production import read as corrected.
  The whole suite now reports **zero** occurrences of that warning.
- `three-subdivide` is pinned **exactly** rather than by caret. The deep path
  `three-subdivide/build/index.module.js` is legal precisely because the package
  declares no `exports` map; a minor release that added one would make the path
  unresolvable, and a caret range would have taken that release silently.
- `src/__tests__/three-subdivide-esm.test.ts` guards the whole tree rather than one
  file, which is the lesson from the partial fix: it walks every `.ts` under `src/`,
  asserts the ESM build has no `require(` call, and asserts the pin is exact.
  Verified by injecting the bare specifier into `src/ops.ts` and confirming the guard
  fails *and names the offending file*, rather than by observing a pass.
- Timing, since it reads as urgent and is not: three deprecated the CommonJS build in
  r186 and has not announced a removal release. Its own precedent — `build/three.js`
  deprecated at r150, removed at r160 — suggests roughly ten releases of runway. The
  reason to fix it now is the warning users see today, not the removal.

## three.js r186, and the CommonJS load it exposed — 2026-09-11

- `three` and `@types/three` to 0.186.0 in both the engine and `render-service`.
  The types were the blocker and they shipped; r186's three named breaking changes
  — `Source` → `TextureSource`, `toTrianglesDrawMode()` mutating in place,
  `Object3D.dispose()` needing `super.dispose()` — touch nothing here, checked
  before the bump rather than discovered by it.
- **`three-subdivide` was pulling three in through the deprecated CommonJS build.**
  It has no `exports` map, so a bare specifier resolves to `main`, which is a UMD
  bundle doing `require("three")`. r186 did not create this; it made it audible, by
  emitting `THREE_CJS_DEPRECATED` on stderr — which every `kiln` CLI invocation
  would then have printed. Fixed by importing the ESM build the package already
  ships, `three-subdivide/build/index.module.js`, which has zero `require(` calls.
  `three-subdivide@1.1.5` is the latest release, so there is no upstream fix to
  wait for, and three has announced the CJS build's removal.
- Worth recording because it is tempting and wrong: this does **not** fix a
  dual-THREE instance hazard. `src/primitives.ts` documents one, and it was
  measured here rather than assumed — geometry from both the CJS and the ESM build
  satisfies `instanceof THREE.BufferGeometry`. The `isBufferGeometry` flag tests
  stay, because they are correct defensively regardless.
- **The GPU service was requesting a shadow filter that no longer exists.** r186
  removed the `PCFSoftShadowMap` implementation while keeping the constant; three
  warns and substitutes `PCFShadowMap`. `render-service` now names the filter it
  actually gets. Material conformance returns numbers identical in every region
  before and after, which is the proof the substitution was already happening.
- Verified on hardware, not only offline: 1,831 pass / 0 fail, typecheck clean,
  lint at the unchanged 14/11 baseline, and `material-conformance` `PASS` on
  `dawn-vulkan` across all six channels. One number to watch —
  `normalHalfLumaDelta` moved 1.51 → 1.2 against a threshold of 1, consistent with
  r186's diffuse energy-conservation change. It passes with less margin than 11.5
  measured, which is an argument for that row's follow-up rather than for a new
  threshold.

## The guide was pinning a toolchain the gate rejects — 2026-09-11

- `AGENTS.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `README.md`, `docs/google.md` and
  `docs/install.md` still named Bun 1.3.14, Node 22.23.1 and npm 12.0.1 after the
  bump to 1.4.2/22.23.2/12.0.2. `AGENTS.md` is the guide every harness reads, so
  the first command a new contributor ran installed a Bun that
  `bun run check:toolchain` — the next command in the same list — then rejected.
- `scripts/check-toolchain.mjs` now asserts those five documents state the
  supported triple, and that `pages.yml` pins the same Bun as `ci.yml`. The gate
  had enforced `package.json` and `ci.yml` and nothing else, so both the prose and
  the second workflow could drift silently; `pages.yml` was correct today only
  because it was set by hand in the same change. Verified by injecting each of the
  three defects and confirming a non-zero exit, rather than by observing a pass.
- Dated receipts under `docs/evaluation/` are deliberately excluded from the
  check. They record the toolchain a run actually used, and rewriting one to match
  a new pin would falsify it.

## Skills are fetchable by URL — 2026-09-11

- The six skills are published at
  `https://kilnstudio.tools/.well-known/agent-skills/index.json`, per
  [Cloudflare's Agent Skills Discovery RFC](https://github.com/cloudflare/agent-skills-discovery-rfc)
  v0.2.0 — which is what OpenCode's `skills.urls` consumes. One `skill-md` entry
  and five archives for the skills carrying `references/`, each with a sha256 of
  the artifact's raw bytes so a client can verify what it fetched.
- The archives are built by hand as POSIX ustar with every non-content field
  pinned — mode 0644, uid/gid 0, mtime 0, sorted entries — because the digest is
  *published*. Neither the system `tar` nor a convenience library gives that by
  default, and an archive whose bytes move on every build publishes a digest that
  is wrong the moment it is written. The test asserts those header fields
  directly rather than only comparing two builds, since two builds agreeing is
  also what a tar with a coarse clock does inside one second.
- Verified end to end: real `tar` extracts the archives with `SKILL.md` at the
  root and contents byte-identical to `skills/`, and Vite copies the
  dot-directory into the published output.
- **This path carries skills and no MCP server**, so a client that loads them has
  the workflows and none of the tools they describe. `docs/install.md` says so
  where it offers the URL.
- **Follow-up:** the first deployment served a 404, and neither the build nor
  Pages was at fault. `actions/upload-pages-artifact` v5 archives with
  `--exclude=.[^/]*` unless `include-hidden-files` is set, so it strips *every*
  hidden path — and a well-known URI is under a dotted directory by definition.
  The artifact had 465 entries and not one dot-entry, while the same build
  locally produced all seven files. Fixed by setting the flag, verified to add
  exactly `.well-known` and nothing else.

## Bun-only APIs cannot reach a Node bundle unnoticed — 2026-09-11

- Audited the shipped bundles for the defect class behind the MCP server's
  `import.meta.main` bug. The bundles were clean of all nine patterns checked —
  but the audit found the identifier still live in
  `src/experiments/geometry-acceptance.ts`, which **ships** (`files` carries
  `src/**/*.ts`). Unbundled under plain `node`, `import.meta.main` is `undefined`,
  so that guard was always *false* and running the script with node did nothing
  at all, silently. The same defect as the MCP one with its sign flipped: there,
  bundling made the guard always *true* and started a server nobody asked for.
  Both now use `isDirectEntry`, which decides from `process.argv[1]`.
- A new guard asserts both halves — no Bun-only API in any committed bundle, and
  no `import.meta.main` deciding an entry point in shipped source. It was
  verified by injecting a defect into each and watching it fail, rather than
  trusted for passing green: the whole reason this class survived is that nothing
  was looking.

## The GPU material check runs for the first time — 2026-09-11

- `render-service/test/material-conformance.mjs` is the only automated evidence
  that the GPU path applies textures at all, and it had never passed. It replaces
  `globalThis.fetch` with a thrower to prove an embedded fixture never crosses a
  network boundary — but `blob:` is an **in-memory** object URL, and three's
  `GLTFLoader` mints one per embedded image that `ImageBitmapLoader` reads back
  through `fetch`. The guard blocked the only path a texture has into the
  renderer, so the file measured an untextured render and asserted against it:
  `lumaSpread: 0` on the albedo checker, with the real cause printed as a loader
  warning nobody read. `blob:` is now exempt, and the guard self-checks that an
  `https:` fetch still throws.
- Its normal-map threshold was `>= 3` and had **never been evaluated**, because
  the albedo assertion above it always failed first. Recalibrated to `>= 1` from
  measurement. The small number is the tone curve rather than a weak response:
  that panel sits at mean luma ~242 of 255 under the fixture's own exposure of
  1.38, past the ACES shoulder. Measured 1.51 at exposure 1.38 and 2.61 at 0.9
  with nothing else changed — which is also the proof that the map applies. An
  absent normal map reads near zero, the way the albedo checker read exactly 0.
- All six channels now verify: albedo, normal, shared ORM, AO, emissive, alpha.

## Artifact identity stops tracking the serializer's version — 2026-09-11

- **`asset.generator` is now a stable `"Kiln"`.** It defaulted to the serializer's
  own version string, so `glTF-Transform v4.4.1` sat inside every artifact's
  bytes and therefore inside `artifactHash`. Taking 4.5.0 moved all 83 recorded
  hashes and failed the gallery build — and the *entire* difference between the
  two GLBs was that one string. Identical BIN chunk, identical accessor min/max,
  identical semantic digest. With the generator pinned, **all 86 examples are
  byte-identical across 4.4.1 and 4.5.0**, including the ones using `palette()`,
  which 4.5.0 changed. A dependency's version number is provenance about the
  tool, not identity of the asset.
- `@gltf-transform/*` moves to an exact **4.5.0**. Still exact, deliberately —
  the version-string cause is gone but other serialization changes are not
  impossible, and a serializer bump should stay a measured decision.
- **A poster receipt no longer asserts `artifactHash`.** It asserts `sourceHash`
  and `imageHash` — this image was rendered from this source — which is what it
  could always honestly claim. Asserting the container's bytes claimed something
  glTF never promised: that rebuilding a source on another platform reproduces
  it byte for byte. The hash stays in the record as provenance, naming the bytes
  the poster was rendered from on the machine that recorded it, and the prose in
  all 83 records no longer calls the poster a render of "the exact downloadable
  GLB".
- Within-run integrity checks are untouched and still hash bytes: the gallery
  index against the files built beside it, the build receipt against the index,
  and both demo receipts against their own run's GLBs.
- **The gallery now builds on Linux.** `bun run site:assets` followed by
  `site/scripts/verify-assets.mjs` completes — 80 source/GLB pairs, posters, both
  edit-demo revisions and the geometry example. Before this it failed on the
  first example.
- `pages.yml` now runs `site/scripts`'s tests explicitly. **Correction:** this
  entry first said those tests had never run in any workflow. They had. `bun run
  test` is `bun test src scripts`, bun treats those as substring filters on
  paths, and `site/scripts` matches `scripts` — so both files were already in the
  suite CI runs. The step stays for a smaller reason: that coverage is
  incidental, and spelling the script `bun test ./src ./scripts` would drop it
  silently.
- **The gallery no longer builds on Windows.** `pages.yml` is `ubuntu-latest`,
  which closes Phase 6.
- New `scripts/glb-chunk-hashes.mjs` splits a GLB by chunk, and it answered the
  question Phase 6 opened with. Measured on 8 examples across both platforms at
  one commit: the JSON chunk diverges in **all 8**, the BIN chunk in **2 of 8**,
  and totals move by 4, 8 and 264 bytes — digit counts changing, which a
  formatting difference cannot do, because ECMAScript specifies number-to-string
  exactly. So the divergence is the float values themselves, most likely the
  transcendentals, which IEEE-754 does not bit-specify. That means no canonical
  serialization could ever have fixed it, and narrowing the receipt was the only
  option that works.

## The renderer starts itself, and now ships — 2026-09-11

- The MCP server **starts the GPU render service on demand**. Installing it
  (`cd render-service && npm install`) is the whole setup: there is no longer a
  second process to start first, and nothing to restart to pick one up. The
  first view that needs PBR shading starts the renderer, the rest of the session
  reuses it, and it stops when the server does. Measured end to end on the
  shipped bundle with nothing listening: the first `kiln_render` came back
  material-faithful from the GPU in 5.4 s, the second in 1.7 s.
  - A service already listening is **joined, not replaced**, and a session that
    merely found one does not stop it on the way out -- so one GPU shared by a
    batch of dispatched agents keeps working, and the agent that finishes first
    cannot pull the renderer out from under the others.
  - A machine that did not install the renderer is **unchanged**, deliberately
    and at the level of the attached port rather than the rendered result: the
    absence of a render port is what makes an ordinary CPU view read as ordinary
    instead of as a degrade.
  - `KILN_RENDER_PORT_URL` and `--render-port` short-circuit all of it, so a
    hosted or remote GPU is still exactly one flag. `KILN_RENDER_SERVICE_PORT`
    moves the local one off 8000.
  - The CLI is deliberately not on this path: a one-shot `kiln render` should not
    pay a GPU process's startup to draw one sheet.
- **`render-service/` now ships in the package.** The MCP server told every model
  that a GPU renderer "ships as render-service/ in this installation"; that was
  false for anyone installing from npm, because the directory was in no `files`
  entry. Its source travels with the package now (104 KB) while its ~94 MB of
  native dependencies stay an explicit opt-in install.
- `webgpu` 0.4.0 -> 0.6.0, smoked on hardware: 36/36 service unit tests, display
  conformance passed, end-to-end smoke all pass.
- A service started **for** you binds loopback; one you start yourself still binds
  every interface, which is what a container deployment needs. `HOST` is now
  honoured either way.

## Review surfaces say what they mean — 2026-09-11

- `viewFidelity.exactArtifact` was a hard-coded `false` literal at every
  `kiln_render` site, never computed. A flag that is always false carries no
  information, and this one invited the opposite of the truth: a model could
  read it as "these bytes differ from what I would export" when the bytes are
  frequently identical. The value is still false -- this surface only ever
  renders an in-loop build -- but it now carries the reason code
  `IN_LOOP_BUILD_NOT_PERSISTED`, so the false value is readable rather than
  ominous.
- `kiln_screenshot_animation` was reported to rotate a whole asset where the
  clip drives one joint. **It does not.** Measured on world matrices rather than
  pixels: a one-channel clip moves the joint's subtree through a clean
  180-degree yaw while the un-animated sibling holds the origin at every phase.
  An image cannot tell a turret sweeping from a scene spinning, which is why the
  report was plausible; a regression test now stands where the doubt was.
- `arrayLinear` and `arrayRadial` say outright that `count` is the total
  including the source, which survives as copy 0 -- so `count: 8` gives eight
  bolts, not nine. The program contract states that
  `kiln_screenshot_animation` requires `clip` by name, that `frameTimes` is
  phases in 0..1 rather than seconds, and that a clip that renders frozen means
  a joint-name mismatch surfaced in `unresolvedTracks`.

## Dependency refresh — 2026-09-11

- Patch and minor bumps with no API surface change: `@types/three` 0.185.4,
  `acorn` 8.18.0, `manifold-3d` 3.5.3, `sharp` 0.35.4, `zod` 4.6.2,
  `@anthropic-ai/sdk` 0.125.0, `@biomejs/biome` 2.5.13, `@google/genai` 2.22.0,
  `@strands-agents/sdk` 1.17.0. `biome.json` follows Biome's own version, which
  the linter checks and which is what actually failed the gate; one test file
  picks up the new formatter's line fitting.
- **`@gltf-transform/*` is now pinned to exactly 4.4.1**, joining `three` and
  `gltf-validator`. 4.5.0 changes the bytes of every exported GLB: all 83
  recorded `artifactHash` values move, and the gallery build fails on a stale
  poster. A caret range on the library that serializes the artifact means the
  artifact's identity can change on an unrelated install, which is not a
  property this project can have. Taking 4.5.0 is a deliberate act with receipts
  re-recorded in the same pass, not a refresh.
- `three` stays at 0.185.1. `@types/three` has no 0.186.x published, and r186
  renames `Source` to `TextureSource` and makes
  `BufferGeometryUtils.toTrianglesDrawMode()` mutate in place rather than clone.
  Taking the runtime without the types would be a net loss.

## Toolchain moved to Bun 1.4.2, and the MCP bundle stopped starting itself — 2026-09-11

- Development toolchain pins move to Bun 1.4.2, Node 22.23.2 and npm 12.0.2.
  Bun 1.4 also fixes the early-exit behaviour above at its source: the pre-fix
  CLI, which produced empty output in 6 of 8 concurrent runs on 1.3.14, produced
  full output in 16 of 16 on 1.4.2. The `withProcessAlive` guard stays -- it
  holds for anyone still on 1.3.x, and nothing in the runtime contract promises
  otherwise. The offline suite runs about 18% faster.
- **`dist/mcp-server.mjs` started a stdio server when merely imported, and had
  done so for as long as the bundle has existed.** The source guarded its entry
  block with `import.meta.main`, a Bun property that no Bun release lowers
  correctly for a `--target=node` bundle. Every lowering emits
  `__require.main == __require.module`; under Node ESM both sides are
  `undefined`, so the guard was always true. Bun 1.4 then stopped emitting the
  `__require` helper that line still references, which turned the same
  expression into a `ReferenceError` before the server could speak -- loud where
  it had been silent, and how this was finally caught. Both entries now decide
  from `process.argv[1]` through a shared `isDirectEntry`, which needs no
  lowering and means the same thing on both runtimes.

## `kiln` commands no longer exit 0 in silence under Bun — 2026-09-11

- Under Bun, a CLI command could exit 0 having written nothing at all: no output,
  no error, no rejection. `kiln save` did it reproducibly under load. The command
  was not failing, it was still running -- Bun does not register the in-flight work
  as an active resource, so the event loop went idle and the process exited before
  `main()` settled. Every entry point was exposed, the generated workspace
  `kiln.mjs` launcher included, because all of them await `main()` and then set
  `process.exitCode`. `main` now holds the process open for its own duration.
  Node was unaffected in practice, but the guard is runtime-agnostic.
- Every CLI destination now creates the directories leading to it. `--out` and
  `--views` failed with a bare `ENOENT` on a missing parent, and failed *after*
  the build had run and printed a `programRef` -- a successful render followed by
  an error naming a path but not the directory as the thing to fix. Covers
  `render --out`, `render --views`, `generate`, `source <ref> --out` and
  `export --out`.

## Usable from a bare clone by any harness; isolate honored on GPU — 2026-09-10

- A bare clone is now usable by claude, codex, opencode, hermes and agy. The root
  `.mcp.json` pointed at `${PLUGIN_ROOT}`, which only Antigravity defines, so the
  server failed to start with MODULE_NOT_FOUND in every other host; it now uses
  `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-.}`, which resolves whether or not the variable is set.
  `CLAUDE.md` imports `AGENTS.md` rather than duplicating it, and the
  `kiln-setup-workspace` skill is registered at `.claude/skills/` and
  `.agents/skills/` so a clone opened for an asset task is told to build a
  workspace instead of authoring in the engine checkout.
- `visibility: 'isolate'` and the legacy `isolate: true` were silently ignored
  whenever a GPU service was attached. Both hide geometry by clearing
  `mesh.visible`; the CPU rasterizer culls on that flag, but glTF carries no
  per-mesh visibility, so the derivative GLB shipped the hidden meshes and the
  service drew them. `kiln_inspect` was reporting "nothing in this image occludes
  it" about images where everything still did. The derivative serialization now
  prunes hidden meshes from a copy, leaving the caller's scene untouched. The
  only previous test framed a single-mesh scene, where isolation cannot change
  the image.
- The generated workspace guide is organised around the authoring loop rather
  than a flat tool list, and presents the MCP server and `node kiln.mjs` as equal
  surfaces that may be mixed, naming the two things that actually differ: where
  the rendered image lands, and that a CPU view is not material evidence. It also
  names the GPU render service, resolving the engine path through
  `.kiln/workspace.json` so `--repair` keeps it accurate, and asks the session to
  report skills and MCP servers it inherited from user-level configuration.
- `START.md` printed a literal `/current/kiln/` in its repair command; it now
  prints the recorded installation path plus how to recover if that moved.

## Smaller clone; gallery images served from R2 — 2026-09-10

- Gallery renders and launch video are no longer carried in git history. A clone
  costs 52 MB and 8 seconds rather than 440 MB and 79 seconds, 48 MB with
  `--filter=blob:none`, and a plugin install no longer pays for 539 MB of
  repository content twice. Packed history went from 226.06 MiB to 17.41 MiB.
- The 88 gallery images moved to Cloudflare R2 byte for byte and are served from
  `assets.kilnstudio.tools`. Nothing was re-encoded: all 83 poster receipts still
  verify against the stored objects, and `scripts/verify-posters.mjs` checks that
  on every gallery build.
- **This rewrote history.** All 177 commits survived and the tree is unchanged
  apart from the removed images and video, but every commit hash changed. Clones
  predating this cannot fast-forward; see the note in `README.md`. Links pinned to
  an old commit SHA will stop resolving; links through `main` are unaffected.
- The launch video was never what the README served -- that comes from GitHub's
  asset CDN -- so the README is unaffected. `assets/gallery/` deliberately stays
  in the repository, so the README grid needs no network.
- Re-encoding the posters to shrink them was considered and rejected: image tokens
  scale with pixel dimensions, not file size, so it would have saved no agent
  context while voiding all 83 receipts.

Full record, including everything rejected and why, in
[docs/plans/repo-size-and-r2-migration-2026-09-10.md](docs/plans/repo-size-and-r2-migration-2026-09-10.md).

## Collections and chat viewing — 2026-09-06

- Save assets into project or personal collections with immutable revisions,
  hashed provenance, original source, and portable editable ZIP bundles.
- Browse collections and imported GLBs in a local viewer with animation controls,
  revision inspection, and GLB/source/bundle downloads.
- Present saved assets in supporting MCP App clients with `kiln_present`.
  ChatGPT viewing was verified; native GLB/ZIP attachment delivery remains
  unverified. Host-provided download links are supported.
- Package complete skills independently or bind them to a ChatGPT connector.
- Add a canonical-only sitemap and crawler discovery file to the project site.

See [dogfood results and remaining work](docs/collections-dogfood.md) and
[indexing diagnostics](docs/site-indexing.md). Package version remains 0.6.0;
this change does not publish a new npm package or promote dogfood assets.

## Public OSS snapshot — 2026-09-05

- Short, immutable source references work across rendering, source reads, edits,
  CLI exports, and MCP restarts. Full hashes remain compatible.
- Project-local setup and skills support authoring, inspection, and refinement
  through the CLI, MCP server, and TypeScript tools.
- Geometry modifiers and configurable asset/part cameras extend the authoring
  and review workflow.
- The redesigned site includes 62 selected assets with source downloads, GLB
  viewers, attribution, and recorded revision histories where available.
- Mechanical Peacock and Deco Radio include documented maintainer repairs.
  Brass Tellurion and Victorian Greenhouse remain archived outside the gallery.
- Package checks cover Windows, Linux, and hosted Apple Silicon/Intel Macs.

The snapshot retains package version 0.6.0. Earlier development notes follow;
their asset counts and workflow descriptions describe those earlier revisions.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- **`site/` is a project site now, not a gallery.** The front page was a wall of
  specimens with a tally of triangles above it, which answered a question nobody
  arriving from a link was asking. It now opens on what Kiln is, the offline command
  that proves the engine works with no model and no key, the exact configuration for
  each of the five harnesses with the gotcha that cost time in each one, and a map of
  where to look in the repository; the specimens moved behind `#/gallery` and are
  reached from a strip of eight. The aggregate counts are gone -- a number is a claim
  about the library, and the library is the thing on the other page. Per-card model
  attribution stays, because that is not a statistic. `REPO` and `asset()` moved out of
  `App.tsx` into a leaf module: once `App` imported a page that read one at module
  scope the cycle turned into a blank screen at first paint, and a module that imports
  nothing cannot be in a cycle.

### Fixed
- **The carousel and orrery GIFs no longer show something the programs beside them
  stopped producing.** Both were flagged in review as showing an earlier revision, and
  both were regenerated on the GPU port from the current source. Nothing in the repo
  ties a GIF to the revision it was rendered from, so the staleness was caught by
  somebody remembering rather than by a gate -- the stills have the same exposure.
  A frame overlay confirms the camera is fixed across both loops and only the authored
  motion moves.

### Added
- **A specimen gallery in `site/`, built by running the programs rather than by
  committing meshes.** The README's stills are a weak claim about geometry -- a lit
  render hides topology, and a reader has no way to tell a dense mesh from a clean one.
  The gallery loads all fifty as real GLBs with orbit controls, a wireframe toggle and
  the triangle count, draw calls, material count and bounds off the engine's own
  integration manifest. Nothing in it is checked in: `site/scripts/build-assets.mjs`
  runs each `examples/*.kiln.js` through the same evaluator the test suite uses and
  keeps what comes back, so a program and the mesh on the page cannot drift, and a
  program that stops building fails the deploy. Attribution on each card comes from the
  program's own header through `scripts/authorship.ts` -- extracted from the authorship
  test so that the README and the gallery read the headers with one parser instead of
  two that will eventually disagree. React and three live in `site/` and nowhere else;
  the engine still has no browser dependency. `.github/workflows/pages.yml` deploys it.
- **A fifth skill, `kiln-batch-dispatch`, for the person pointing agents at the problem
  rather than the agent building the asset.** The other four are read by whoever is
  holding the geometry; this one covers wiring a harness up, proving the tools are
  actually reachable before trusting a single result, and running the clean-room
  dispatcher across models and subjects until you have a library. It exists because
  the two halves fail as one: a batch launched on unproven wiring produces a pile of
  empty sandboxes, and no way to tell whether the models were weak or the tools were
  never there. It also writes down the two limits that cost the most time here -- a
  harness's default output cap silently truncating a model mid-file, and a run cut off
  at its deadline still being a success if a usable program is on disk.
- **`--category` on the dispatcher, with six experimental values and one honest
  default.** Every asset ever dispatched from this repository came back
  `category: 'prop'`, because the brief said so in a string literal. The problem was
  never that they were props -- most of them are, correctly, and almost anything can be
  built as one -- but that the field carried no information, so a library could not be
  sorted by it and the engine's per-category guidance was unreachable. The flag takes
  any of the seven contract values and rejects anything else in the first second rather
  than filing an asset under nothing. `prop` stays the default and its brief is
  deliberately empty, which makes it the least constrained thing the dispatcher can
  send. The other six append a short note on what tends to go wrong for that kind of
  subject, and they are a bet rather than a taxonomy: worth reaching for when the
  subject really is a building or a plant, worth dropping first when a run comes back
  worse than the same brief as a prop. `src/__tests__/dispatch-categories.test.ts` fails
  if the list the script carries ever drifts from `ASSET_CATEGORIES`.
- **Hermes as a fifth harness, which is the first real evidence that any of this is
  portable.** The other four are JavaScript CLIs that broadly agree on what a plugin
  is; Hermes is a Python agent with its own YAML config, its own skill store and its
  own provider routing, sharing no code and no convention with them. It takes the
  same `dist/mcp-server.mjs` and the same `skills/` directory unchanged: `hermes mcp
  add` connects on the spot and enumerates all seven tools, and
  `hermes config set skills.external_dirs` registers every shipped skill as `local`. It
  does not read `.claude/skills` out of the working directory the way the others do,
  and that config key is the whole difference. Smoke-tested green at 97s on a free
  model. `-z` is the headless mode the dispatcher drives, and since it has no
  working-directory flag the sandbox is simply the CWD it is spawned in -- which is
  also where it reads `AGENTS.md`, so the clean room holds without extra work.
- **`bun run smoke:harness`, which proves a harness can reach the tools.** Every
  wiring failure in this project has been silent: `agy plugin validate` reports the
  MCP server as processed while `agy mcp list` shows none, and a harness that can
  see the tools but will not grant them answers exactly like one that never had
  them -- which is also what a model too weak for the job looks like. Three
  indistinguishable failures with one symptom is a thing worth being able to test,
  so this sends a short brief into a throwaway directory -- call
  `kiln_list_primitives`, write a four-line program, validate it -- and then builds
  what came back with the engine, because the child's own report of success is the
  only evidence that proves nothing. Measured on one machine: Claude Code 13s,
  OpenCode 37s, Antigravity 105s, each green. Codex reached the model and stopped
  at its account's own usage limit, which is the diagnosis the script exists to
  make -- the wiring is fine and the provider is out. Codex has since been smoked
  green as well, at 37s, once the flag below let it call a tool at all.
- **A fourth vendor in the gallery, and a wider spread of subject.** This step took
  the heroes to twenty-seven, and the additions were chosen for the range they prove
  rather than for how they look: a supercarrier, a phased-array air-defence radar,
  a fighter with a lofted aerofoil and a geostationary comms satellite, which are
  the subjects where a program has to compute its shape rather than place it, and a
  Dutch tower windmill written by DeepSeek V4 Flash -- the first asset here from a
  fourth vendor's model, dispatched clean-room through OpenCode like the Muse Spark
  ones. The anglerfish was rebuilt: the first was a smooth dark cone with a jaw
  drawn on it, and organic form is the case this tool is worst at, so it is the one
  worth showing honestly. Eleven of those twenty-seven were not written by Claude.
- **Tangents for non-indexed geometry.** `computeTangentBasis` required an index
  buffer and warned, per mesh, when there was not one -- so a normal map on any
  flat-shaded part, anything merged from several geometries, and anything through
  `.toNonIndexed()` shipped with no TANGENT attribute and a note saying each runtime
  would guess its own. That is most of what a hand-built asset is made of. A
  triangle soup is an index buffer that reads 0, 1, 2, ..., so the same accumulation
  is exactly right for it and every vertex comes out holding its own face's tangent;
  a test unwelds a box and checks the soup and the indexed copy agree per vertex.
  `examples/anglerfish.kiln.js` had twelve of those warnings and now has none.
- **A measured ceiling on the always-on context cost.** `src/__tests__/mcp-payload.test.ts`
  now derives the JSON Schema for all seven tools and sums the front matter of every
  shipped skill, holds each under a budget, and requires the README to quote the real
  figures. The README argued the surface was small with numbers nothing was checking.
- **`kiln_edit`, the refine verb, and the `kiln-refine-asset` skill that drives it.**
  Every MCP tool took a whole program and rendered it, so changing one line of a
  finished asset meant re-emitting the entire file and trusting that the other two
  hundred lines came back unchanged. `kiln_edit` takes exact-string replacements
  instead: they apply in order, a match that is not unique is refused rather than
  guessed at, and if any edit fails **nothing** is applied -- so a bad edit costs a
  retry rather than a program in a state the model never asked for. It returns the
  patched source, a unified diff, and the six-view sheet together, because the loop
  is edit-then-look. It is deliberately stateless: the in-process agent keeps a
  working buffer across turns, but over MCP the host holds the program text, and a
  second copy inside the server would have been a desync the model cannot see. The
  buffer itself moved to `src/edit-buffer.ts` so both transports share one
  implementation -- importing it from `agent/tools.ts` would have pulled
  `@strands-agents/sdk` into `kiln/tools` and into the MCP bundle, which is the one
  edge that subpath is documented not to have. Like the unified `kiln_render`, the
  def sits outside `createKilnToolRegistry`, whose four tools are a frozen bench
  baseline.
- **The scanned texture library doubled, from eight CC0 families to sixteen.** The
  first eight were all rough exterior surfaces, which left three material recipes --
  `skin`, `leaf`, and `rubber` -- with nothing photographic to bind at all, and made
  rust the only metal in the package. Added: brown leather, forest leaf litter,
  rubber tiles, riveted steel plate, clay roof tiles, cobblestone paving, finished
  oak veneer, and polished marble. 48 maps, 747,977 embedded bytes, still inside the
  1 MiB package budget the test enforces.
- **OpenCode support, and clean-room dispatch.** `scripts/dispatch-asset.mjs` gained an
  `opencode` harness, reaching a dozen vendors' models behind `provider/model` ids.
  More importantly, every dispatch now runs in its own directory containing only the
  brief and the Kiln skills. Dispatches previously ran with the harness pointed
  at this repository, where a child agent could read thirteen finished example
  programs -- which quietly invalidated the claim those runs were evidence for. The
  write grant is scoped to the sandbox, and the authoring model is stamped into the
  program it wrote. `examples/gramophone.kiln.js` is the first asset in the gallery
  actually built that way -- authored through OpenCode by
  `muse-spark-1.3-contributor`, a third vendor's model, in a directory holding
  nothing but the brief and the skills. Every other example predates the sandbox and
  is attributed without the clean-room claim.
- **Animated GIFs of the animated examples, via `scripts/anim-gifs.ts`.** The
  render port fits its camera to the bounding box it is handed, which is right for
  a still and wrong for a sequence -- a robot arm's posed extent varies 63% across
  its cycle, so the asset would appear to breathe as the camera refit itself each
  frame. Because the projection is orthographic and the port's fit is exact, each
  frame is put back onto one shared camera afterwards by a scale and a translation
  that are both computable, so the result is a fixed camera rather than an
  approximation of one.
- **`scripts/check-vision.mjs`, a preflight that refuses to dispatch a blind model.**
  Kiln's loop is the model looking at its own render, so image input is the one
  capability that is not optional -- and a text-only model does not fail, it just
  builds worse assets from the documentation alone. A nine-model batch here was
  found to contain four text-only models, picked by name on the assumption that a
  current flagship accepts images. Vision also varies between a vendor's own
  variants: `glm-5.3-flash` sees images and `glm-5.3` does not. The check reads
  OpenCode's cached model metadata, costs about two seconds for any number of
  models, and exits non-zero naming the offenders.
- **Browser-safe GLB integration manifest.** Every `renderGLB` / `renderSceneToGLB`
  result now carries `kiln.integration-manifest.v1`: artifact SHA-256, metre/+Y-up
  coordinate semantics, world bounds, ground offset, role, render metrics, and
  structural-validator counts. `inspectGlbIntegration(bytes)` derives the same
  contract from finished bytes without executing model-authored source.
- **Four assets from a sixth model, through a sixth harness.** GPT-6 Astra wrote an
  orbital station, a rigid airship at its mooring mast, a blast furnace and a Gothic
  clock tower, dispatched through Codex into the usual clean room. They are the first
  batch in this repository where every program cleared the zero-structural-warning bar
  the shipped examples are held to on the first pass, with no hand repair and no
  promotion-time fix, at 10,212 / 11,764 / 11,964 / 11,664 triangles. The gallery is
  now fifty programs, thirty-five of them written by something other than Claude.

### Fixed
- **The Codex harness could not call a single tool, and said so only in the child's
  transcript.** `codex exec` pins its approval policy to `never`, and a `never` policy
  does not queue an MCP call for later approval, it refuses it outright -- so four
  dispatches came back inside a minute each having written nothing but a note that
  `kiln_list_primitives` was blocked. The dispatcher passed `--sandbox
  workspace-write`, which grants the filesystem and says nothing about tools;
  `--approve-for-me` is the flag that does both, selecting the same sandbox and moving
  approval to automatic review, and the two are mutually exclusive on the command line
  for exactly that reason. Worth noting alongside it: `codex plugin add` installs this
  repository's manifest happily and registers neither its MCP servers nor its skills,
  so the TOML server block is still required -- the same trap `agy` sets, failing the
  same silent way. Both are now documented per-harness in `docs/install.md`.
- **`cylinderUnwrap` now unwraps cylindrically, which it has always claimed to do.**
  It and `boxUnwrap` were the same function: both preserved existing UVs and both fell
  back to the same flat projection, so on the one case the file's own header describes
  -- a curved surface carrying a directional texture -- brick came out as horizontal
  smears. Built-in `cylinderGeo` never hit it because Three.js ships UVs with it;
  anything swept or extruded did, and a texture-backed material on unwrapped geometry
  is a QA blocker rather than a silent miss. It now runs u around the Y axis and v up
  the height, normalized across the geometry's own angular span so a 22 degree curb
  stone gets the whole texture rather than six percent of its width, with caps
  projected flat so they do not sample a single row of texels.
- **The well, which was a ring of boxes pretending to be masonry.** A box has parallel
  sides, so on a circle its neighbours meet it at an angle and the joint opens into a V
  that widens toward the outside face -- 40 mm of it at the outer radius, sixteen times
  around, which read as a cog wheel with a dark slot at every tooth. The curb is now cut
  the way a mason would cut it: wedge stones whose side faces lie on radial planes,
  inner and outer faces following the curve, in two courses offset by half a step so no
  joint runs the full height. The shaft is lined with an extruded ring rather than a
  solid cylinder, since the hole is the point of a well, and there is water at the
  bottom of it. The roof posts are bedded rather than balanced: a square post stopped on
  a round wall always reads as overhanging it, because from any angle where the wall
  curves away it does, so each post now runs past both courses to the plinth and the
  three stones on its line are cut around it with `boolDiff`. Only those stones lose
  their instancing -- an angular overlap test picks them out, one per post in the
  un-skewed course and two in the skewed one where the post straddles a joint.
- **The pinball machine's backbox, which stood on nothing.** It was built entirely
  behind the cabinet's rear face, cantilevered off a 30 mm wall. Sliding it forward onto
  the cabinet only traded one fault for another: the playfield runs the cabinet's full
  length, so everything the head gained in support it took out of the glass, and at
  380 mm deep it buried the bumpers. The fix was the one a real machine already uses --
  the cabinet grew the rear bay the head bolts to. It is 1.34 m long instead of 1.14, its
  rear face and back legs moved with it, the backbox is 200 mm deep rather than 380, and
  the head now sits on that bay entirely behind the glass. The file's header records the
  repair, because the gallery makes a claim about who wrote each program and a claim
  quietly edited afterwards is worse than no claim.
- **The vending machine's sold-out column, which read as a hole in the model.** One
  unlit column was meant to be the asymmetry that stops a 4 x 3 grid looking like a
  texture. It is, but everything in that column -- the dimmed panel, the bezel shelves,
  the rails -- is near-black, so instead of an empty rack behind a switched-off light it
  came out as a solid black rectangle with no shape in it, next to three lit columns. All
  four columns are stocked now, with an amber PET added as the fourth product, and the
  asymmetry that survives is the one that was always doing the work: cans in one column,
  bottles in the other three.
- **The vending machine's bin label, which was a flat plate on a round drum.** A 240 mm
  slab across a 390 mm bin touches it along one line: the middle sinks in and both ends
  stand 40 mm proud, which from the front reads as a white wing growing out of the side.
  It is now an annular sector swept up through the label's height -- the same wedge the
  well's curb stones are cut from -- sitting 6 mm proud all the way round.
- **`createPart` now rejects a wrong call instead of dying in the exporter.** The
  harness smoke run found this the way it was always going to be found: a free model
  on Hermes wrote `createPart(root, { name, geo, material })` -- the shape most other
  scene APIs take -- and the run failed 185 seconds later with `undefined is not an
  object (evaluating 'Object.keys(morphAttributes)')`. Nothing in that sentence names
  anything the model wrote, so it had no way back and spent its remaining turns
  guessing. `new THREE.Mesh()` accepts any two arguments at all, which is what let a
  function reference and a plain object travel that far. The three positional
  arguments are now checked at the door, and each message says which argument, what
  arrived, and what the call looks like when it is right: a parent passed first is
  told the parent belongs in the options object, `boxGeo` without parentheses is told
  geometry helpers have to be called, an un-awaited `roundedBoxGeo` is told the helper
  is async and `build()` has to be too, and a hex number where a material belongs is
  told to wrap it. The same program now fails in under a second with a sentence a
  model can act on.
- **Three hero assets whose geometry was wrong in ways a contact sheet hides.** The
  ferris wheel braced its two A-frames together at mid-height, and the upper tie sat
  1.93 m from the hub inside a 3.60 m rim -- a girder straight through the spokes and
  the cars. It is now a clearance rule rather than a pair of chosen heights: candidate
  bracing levels are filtered against the wheel's swept envelope, rim radius plus how
  far a car hangs below its pin, and only the low portal survives, which is exactly
  where a real double-A-frame wheel is braced. The vending machine's cans were albedo
  `0x4a2f0c` at metalness 0.78; a metal has no diffuse term, so its whole appearance
  is a specular reflection tinted by its albedo, and a near-black albedo under a
  neutral studio dome returns almost nothing -- the cans rendered as black rectangles
  and their column read as empty stock. A printed can is a coating over the metal, so
  it is dielectric like the bottles, and only the bare lid is aluminium. And the
  lighthouse's keeper's cottage stood a plain rectangular slab on each end wall as a
  gable, leaving 0.91 m of stone above the slate at both eaves; the gables are now
  pentagons derived from the roof pitch through `extrudeProfile`, tucked 20 mm under
  the roof underside so the two cannot fight for the same pixel.
- **An external 32,000-token ceiling was ending dispatched runs mid-thought.**
  OpenCode caps one assistant step at 32,000 output tokens by default, whatever the
  model publishes. It is not a number this project set, and it took reading its
  session store to see: across every step ever recorded there, nothing had exceeded
  32,000 -- not once, not by a token -- while the models involved declare between
  80,000 and 943,718. Runs stopped there mid-sentence, with no file and no error,
  looking exactly like a model that was not up to the work. Dispatch now sets
  `OPENCODE_EXPERIMENTAL_OUTPUT_TOKEN_MAX` per run from the model's own declared
  limit, read out of OpenCode's model catalog, so the ceiling is the provider's and
  never one invented here. `docs/install.md` says how to do the same by hand.
- **Removed every default cap on how much work an agent may do.** The generation
  budget defaulted to 40 model calls, `--max-steps` to 24, and whole-program
  rewrites after a first successful render to 2. All three were cost guards from a
  hosted product where the operator paid for the calls. Out here the person running
  the tool is the person paying for it, and a ceiling they did not choose stops an
  asset halfway for reasons that have nothing to do with the asset. All three now
  default to no limit -- zero was already this codebase's "unlimited" value,
  honoured by the call budget, the step hook and the grade-refine headroom check,
  so this is a default change rather than new machinery. `--max-steps` also accepts
  `0` now instead of rejecting the value its own help text recommends, and the
  rewrite bound became a per-host option so a caller who wants it can still ask.
  The sandbox byte limits, the procedural texture bounds and the render deadlines
  stay: those are safety and correctness, not cost.
- **Nothing told a model to write the file before it had solved the asset.** The
  skill's loop said "write the program" at step two and "write the *final* program
  to a file" at step six, which invites a model to keep the whole thing in its head
  until it is finished. Some do, and never arrive: measured through OpenCode's
  session store, four separate runs spent their entire output allowance -- to the
  token -- on one unbroken reasoning block, hand-solving pin positions and cylinder
  attachment points in prose until they were cut off mid-number, having written
  nothing at all. Three different vendors' models failed this way. The loop now
  says to save a rough version early, says plainly not to solve the geometry
  analytically first, and names the failure so a model can recognise it. The
  dispatch brief says the same.
- **Attribution rested on the request rather than on what ran.** The dispatcher
  stamped the model it had *asked* for, which is the one claim the gallery exists
  to make and the one thing it was not checking. It now reads the model back out
  of the harness's own output and records that, reporting the difference if the
  two ever disagree. No harness has been caught substituting a model -- every one
  of the six OpenCode runs already promoted agrees with its log -- so this closes
  a gap rather than a leak, and makes "nothing in the gallery is misattributed" a
  statement backed by a check instead of an assumption.
- **Codex could never have authored an asset.** Three faults in its entry in the
  dispatch table, each of which fired before the model saw the brief, which is why
  nothing in the gallery came from it and why nothing said so. `--full-auto` is
  deprecated in favour of an explicit `--sandbox`. A clean room is a bare temp
  directory, and Codex refuses to start in one as "not inside a trusted directory"
  unless the git check is waived. And the sandbox was never passed at all: with no
  `--cd` the child ran in this repository, with every finished example in reach --
  the exact contamination the sandbox exists to prevent, in the one harness whose
  results would have been quietly worthless rather than merely absent. Its default
  model is now unset rather than `gpt-5.1-codex`, which that account is not entitled
  to and which no repository can guess; dispatch demands `--model` instead of
  stamping an author it cannot name.
- **The dispatcher's usage line omitted OpenCode**, which had written six of the
  twenty-seven programs in the gallery at the time. It is generated from the harness
  table now, so it cannot drift from the list it describes again.
- **A busy GPU renderer was read as an absent one.** `--render auto` probed
  `/health` with a 1.5 second budget and treated anything that was not a clean
  answer as "no service here". The render service is single-threaded, so while it
  is drawing somebody else's frame it accepts the socket and answers late, and a
  batch of agents pointed at one GPU had runs silently drop to the CPU rasterizer
  and judge their materials off a sheet where every textured surface is flat white.
  Nothing logged a fault, because from the caller's side nothing had failed. The
  probe now distinguishes the two: a refused connection still falls through at once,
  which is the point of the short budget on machines with no renderer at all, but a
  timeout is retried against an 8 second one. `src/__tests__/cli-render-mode.test.ts`
  holds a stand-in service to both cases and to the closed port.
- **Material constructors accepted an options object as their colour.**
  `gameMaterial(color, options?)` takes the colour first, and a program that wrote
  `gameMaterial({ color, roughness, metalness })` got a white material at default
  roughness rather than an error: `THREE.Color.set` ignores an object it does not
  recognise, so the mistake survives all the way to the render, where it looks like
  a lighting problem. It cost a real asset an afternoon. All four constructors now
  refuse a non-colour first argument and say where the settings go.
- **A dispatched program that outlived its own run lost its author.**
  `scripts/dispatch-asset.mjs` recorded the authoring model only on a clean exit,
  so a run that wrote a finished program and then hit a wall was scored as having
  produced nothing: the file was still promoted, and stamped `Authored by: null`.
  Which is worse than an honest partial claim, because it is not a claim at all.
  Three assets in this gallery were written that way. The check is now "is there a
  program on disk", asked before the failure is classified rather than inside one
  branch of it, so it covers every way a run can be cut short instead of the one
  that was noticed first -- a provider limit, and the dispatcher's own 25 minute
  deadline, both of which fire long after the program is written. The
  interruption is carried into the manifest and stated plainly in the file header,
  because a run that was cut off cannot claim it looked at its own render and
  revised. Separately, the rate-limit matcher knew `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`, `429` and
  `quota` but not "session limit", which is Claude Code's wording, so a batch that
  hit one reported three flat failures and gave up instead of falling back or
  waiting the window out.
- **`examples/aircraft-carrier.kiln.js` wore a comb of teeth around its counter.**
  The hull, the flight deck and the deck-edge netting were runs of axis-aligned
  slabs, each held at the half-beam or the deck width of its own centre. Wherever
  the ship is not parallel to its own keel -- the fine entry, the whole counter, the
  stern round-in where the starboard edge sweeps 21 m outboard in 23 -- every join
  left an end cap facing aft, and an end cap is lit as a different surface from the
  plating either side of it. Halving the station spacing only doubled the number of
  teeth, because the discontinuity was in the normals and not in the size of the
  step. All three are now lofted along their own planform curves, which share their
  vertices: no cap to catch the light, no step to refine, and 7,000 fewer triangles
  than the slabs cost.
- **Dispatched Claude runs stopped for permission with nobody to ask.**
  `--permission-mode acceptEdits` grants writes and nothing else, so a child that
  reached for `kiln_render` blocked on a prompt no terminal was attached to. Three of
  four runs in one batch returned after a minute having written no program, no error
  and exit 0 -- just a courteous note about which permissions they would need, which
  is the worst shape a failure can take on an unattended path. The sandbox now ships
  a `.claude/settings.json` allowing the Kiln MCP tools under either install name
  plus the file tools, scoped to the one throwaway directory rather than reaching for
  `--dangerously-skip-permissions`.
- **A dispatch deadline that could not actually end a run.** `--timeout` fired on
  schedule, wrote "timed out; killed" into the log, and then called `child.kill()`,
  which signals the direct child and nothing beneath it. On the path that matters
  that child is a shell: an npm-installed CLI on Windows is a `.cmd` shim, so the
  agent itself is a grandchild and survived. It went on holding the stdout pipe
  open, `close` never fired, and the job hung after having already been declared
  dead -- three jobs in one batch sat between 14 and 38 minutes past a 24-minute
  deadline, with a concurrency slot held by each. The deadline now kills the
  process tree (`taskkill /T` on Windows; elsewhere the child is spawned as its own
  process-group leader so the group takes the signal), and the promise settles on a
  15-second grace timer whether or not `close` ever arrives, so a descendant that
  refuses to die costs one job rather than the batch.
- **Orthographic views now fit what they are looking at.** The GPU render service
  framed every view with `max(sizeX, sizeY, sizeZ) * 0.72` -- the longest axis
  whichever way the camera was pointed, padded by a constant -- so anything that was
  not a cube rendered small in a large frame, and a long object viewed down its own
  axis was framed for a length nobody could see. Views are now fitted per direction
  by projecting the bounding box's eight corners onto the camera basis, which is
  exact for an orthographic projection. This also makes `--render cpu` and
  `--render gpu` frame identically: the CPU rasterizer has always fitted this way,
  and the two disagreeing meant the documented side-by-side of the two modes was not
  comparing the same crop. `render-service/src/framing.mjs` is the whole of it, and
  it is GPU-free so it is covered by unit tests.
- **Unit-length normals out of `lathe()` and `revolveGeo()`.** `THREE.LatheGeometry`
  copies its running meridian normal into the previous-normal slot *before*
  normalising it, so the final ring of a revolve carried normals scaled by the length
  of the last profile segment -- enough to fail `GLTF_ACCESSOR_VECTOR3_NON_UNIT` on
  export. Both entry points now normalise before returning.
- **`kiln_list_primitives` no longer sends its catalog twice.** The result carried
  all 92 entries as a structured array *and* as the text rendered from that array,
  and the default MCP serialization pretty-printed both: 90,497 bytes for one call.
  Harnesses disagree about results that size. OpenCode truncates them, spills the
  full copy to a file, and hands the model a cut-off catalog -- a dispatched
  `glm-5.3` run spent twenty-two minutes grepping that spill file at increasing
  offsets and never wrote a program. `KilnToolDef` gained an optional `text()`
  extractor (the text analogue of the existing `media()`), so a def whose output
  already contains a rendered form of itself can send that instead of a JSON dump.
  In-process callers still get `primitives` from `run()`. Measured after: 36,647
  bytes, received in full, with the same model correctly enumerating all 92
  primitives. `src/__tests__/mcp-payload.test.ts` holds the ceiling.
- **Unit-length normals out of `subdivide()`.** `three-subdivide` builds each new
  vertex normal by summing the normals of the faces meeting there and never divides
  through, so a normal comes back at the length of however many faces touched it --
  2/3 after one iteration on a box, 0.35 after two. No raster shows it, because a
  shader normalises before it lights, but the glTF validator rejects every one of
  them. Found by a dispatched agent whose printing-press bed was
  `subdivide(boxGeo(1.5, 0.6, 0.8), 2)`: 1,104 bad normals out of 1,152, and the
  build stopped at final-glb. Same repair as `lathe()`.
  `src/__tests__/subdivide-normals.test.ts` also asserts the raw upstream call is
  still broken, so the workaround can be removed the day that changes.
- **Explicit default scenes on exported GLBs.** Generated and composed artifacts now
  set the glTF default scene, and optimize/palette rewrites repair legacy files whose
  first scene existed without being selected. Consumers no longer have to guess which
  scene to mount.
- **`kiln_screenshot_animation` no longer rejects every textured asset.** The tool
  poses the scene and exports it again to render one camera cell, and that export
  was being submitted to asset QA as though it were a new asset. It is not: those
  bytes came out of this engine and had already passed. But a texture that has been
  through a GLB round trip returns as a decoded image without the payload
  provenance `MAT_TEXTURE_DECODE_FAILED` looks for, so QA blocked the preview --
  meaning no textured asset could look at its own animation, including
  `examples/robot-arm.kiln.js`, which is the repository's designated animation
  example. `renderSceneToGLB` gained a `derivative` option that makes QA observe
  rather than block for exactly this re-serialization; reports still record their
  real disposition, and the option is far narrower than the process-wide
  `KILN_QA_MODE` escape hatch.
- **Dispatched agents no longer hang after finishing their work.** `scripts/dispatch-asset.mjs`
  spawned children with stdin as an open pipe. OpenCode keeps its process alive while stdin is open,
  so a run would author the asset, write the file, and then sit there until the dispatch timeout
  killed it and reported a failure. Children are now spawned with stdin closed; the same command
  that ran to a 75-second kill exits in six.
- **The dispatch sandbox is a real one.** It was created under `.dogfood/`, inside this repository,
  so a child agent's CLI resolved the project root by walking up to `.git` and found the whole repo,
  `examples/` included. It now lives in the OS temp directory.
- **The MCP server no longer needs Bun on the consumer's PATH.** Every published
  config said `"command": "bun"`, which asks the harness to resolve a name against
  its own environment. Bun's Windows installer appends to the *User* PATH, and a
  process only ever sees the environment it was born with, so any harness started
  before that install died with `exec: "bun": executable file not found in %PATH%`.
  There is no Bun-specific API on the server's runtime path, so it now ships as
  `dist/mcp-server.mjs`, a committed Node bundle -- committed because a plugin install
  is a git clone with no build step. Bun remains the development toolchain and is no
  longer something a user of the plugin needs.

## [0.6.0] -- 2026-07-12

### Added
- **`measureGlbBounds(bytes)` (H-41).** World-space AABB straight from stored GLB
  bytes (WebIO + `getBounds`, EXT_mesh_gpu_instancing registered) so consumers that
  only hold the artifact never need `executeKilnCode` to recover a footprint --
  Kiln Studio's compose catalog drops its execute-model-code bbox fallback on this.
- **Six-grid rear-quarter variant (H-33 arm).** `SIX_VIEWS_REAR_QUARTER` swaps the
  3/4 cell to the opposite-rear azimuth (`[-0.7, 0.5, -0.7]`, labeled `3/4 Rear`);
  `resolveGridViews(variant)` + the `KILN_GRID_VARIANT=rear-quarter` env select it
  as the `renderViewGrid` default per-process -- no wire or tool-schema change.
  Explicit `opts.views` always wins; unknown env values fall back to `SIX_VIEWS`.
- **Gemini thinking + budget knob (H-43/B1).** The `google` provider now forwards
  `KilnModelDescriptor.maxTokens` → `generationConfig.maxOutputTokens` and effort
  keywords → `thinkingConfig.thinkingLevel` ('xhigh'/'max' collapse to 'high';
  numbers ignored; the KILN_THINKING env stays Anthropic-only). A bare descriptor
  still sends nothing -- Gemini API defaults (65,536 output, dynamic thinking) are
  preserved unless a consumer opts in. NOTE for consumers: registry rows that
  carried a decorative Google `maxTokens` now BIND -- set them to the intended
  ceiling before upgrading.

### Changed
- **The texture library's signal floor is now two floors instead of one.** The
  package-weight test asserted every map's peak channel deviation cleared 2, which
  worked while all eight families were rough: it was really asking "is this real
  photography rather than a proof swatch". Extending the library to smooth materials
  broke it for the right reason -- a polished marble normal map and an oak veneer
  normal map are *supposed* to be near-flat, and one high floor would have quietly
  restricted the library to rough surfaces forever. Per map the assertion is now
  only that the image is not constant; the photography claim is enforced per family,
  where it belongs.
- **OpenRouter reasoning clamp (A7).** `resolveOpenRouterReasoning(thinking,
  maxTokens?)` now bounds reasoning by the completion budget: numeric budgets cap
  at 50% of `maxTokens` (dropped entirely when even the 1024 floor exceeds that
  half), and 'high'/'xhigh' downgrade to 'medium' when OpenRouter's ~80%
  translation would leave < 8,192 visible tokens (the cycle-2 step-1 MaxTokens
  deaths: a 32K model at 'high' kept only ~6.4K for visible output). 64K/48K
  configurations are untouched.
- **QA-blocked render errors are actionable (H-40(3)).** `AssetQaBlockedError`'s
  message now spells out each blocker's human message + authored `repairText`
  (first 6, then a count) instead of bare rule codes -- this string is exactly what
  the agent reads when a mid-loop `kiln_render` is QA-blocked, and what the
  salvage path records for QA-blocked step-cap programs.

### Measured
- **Per-render QA cost (H-40(4), `scripts/qa-cost-bench.ts`):** registry rules add
  1–10 ms p95 per render across all five category fixtures; Khronos validation
  (unconditional, both modes) adds 1–4 ms p95. Two orders of magnitude under the
  1.5 s follow-up threshold -- mid-loop QA stays on unconditionally.

## [0.4.0] -- 2026-07-02

### Added
- **M1c GPU-instancing pass (plan/05 §3.3).** `renderSceneToGLB`/`renderGLB` gain an
  `instance: 'off' | 'auto' | 'on'` option (default `auto` = only `role: 'fill'` assets)
  and `optimizeGlbBytes` gains `{ instance, role }` -- the web-tier re-bake seam, so the
  pass reaches prod with no wire change. Repeated geometry (>= 5 nodes sharing one mesh
  after dedup) is rewritten to `EXT_mesh_gpu_instancing` batches in the upstream-canonical
  `dedup → instance → palette` order, cutting draw calls + bytes for fence runs /
  colonnades / container stacks. **Perf/filesize only -- the A–F grade keys on material
  count and does not move** (tests assert grade + triangle parity). Skipped for
  animated/skinned docs and any asset carrying `Joint*` pivot names (Kiln City targets
  those by name). Results are recorded as `InstancingSummary` (`meta.instancing`,
  `RenderSceneResult.instancing`, `OptimizeGlbResult.instancing` -- and
  `OptimizeGlbResult.summary` is now optional: an instancing-only pass has no
  consolidation summary). All engine glTF IO now registers `EXTMeshGPUInstancing`
  (new dep `@gltf-transform/extensions`) so re-reads (grade-from-bytes,
  optimize-from-bytes, palette snap, scene export merge) preserve the batches, and
  `collectGlbMetrics` is instance-aware (an instanced node counts one draw but N× its
  triangles -- exactly what a supporting GPU renders).
- **M3 composer role/tier awareness (plan/05 §4.1).** `CatalogEntry` gains optional
  `role` (`CatalogAssetRole` -- the M1d asset taxonomy) + `tier` (A–F); `catalogList()`
  (and therefore `scene_list_assets`) surfaces them. Placement roles now DEFAULT from
  the catalog asset's role via `placementRoleForAsset` (wonder/poi → hero, fill → fill,
  else support) in `place`/`placeExact`/`cluster`/`ring`/`layout` -- an explicit agent
  role still wins. The composer system prompt teaches the mapping, wonder scale-up, and
  D/F-tier density budgeting.

## [0.3.0] -- 2026-07-02

### Added
- **Generation-loop transcript compaction (default on).** Before every model call,
  `runKilnAgent` now strips the image out of each SUPERSEDED render tool result
  (kiln_render / kiln_screenshot / kiln_view_interior / animation strips), swapping it for
  a short text placeholder -- only the newest render image rides each request. The prune is
  surgical, unlike the composer's whole-transcript collapse: no messages are added or
  removed, toolUseIds are untouched (tool-use/tool-result pairing stays valid on every
  provider), and the JSON metrics half of each result survives. This was the biggest
  input-token/cost lever in a multi-render run -- previously every render image rode ALL
  later model calls. Opt out per run with `imageCompaction: 'off'`. New helpers exported
  from `agent`: `pruneStaleRenderImages`, `installRenderImageCompaction`,
  `STALE_RENDER_PLACEHOLDER`.
- **M1b grade-aware refine loop (plan/05 §3.2, default on).** After the model finalizes,
  the run bakes + grades the program exactly as the shipped artifact will be graded
  (grade-aware `auto` consolidation, matching `generateKilnAsset` and the Studio web-tier
  re-bake). If it still grades below B for a consolidation-fixable reason -- material
  sprawl (>3 distinct) or texture sprawl (>4), never a transparency-only demotion (glass
  caps at C by design) -- and the step budget leaves headroom, ONE bounded feedback turn
  (grade, material count, offending material list, consolidation directive) is fed back;
  the refined program is kept only if its grade actually improves. Opt out with
  `gradeRefine: 'off'`. Emits a `grade_refine` progress event; token usage now accumulates
  across the extra invoke. New helpers exported from `agent`: `assessProgramGrade`,
  `shouldGradeRefine`, `buildGradeRefineMessage`, `gradeRank`.

### Fixed
- **Step-cap abort no longer discards a rendered program.** A run halted by the model-call
  cap used to return only an error, throwing away the working-buffer program the sink
  already held. If the captured program renders, the run now returns it with the new
  `RunKilnAgentResult.capped: true` flag (mirrors the composer's `capped` semantics); a
  cap with nothing renderable is still an `error`.

## [0.2.0] -- 2026-07-02

The release cut the 0.1.1 composer note promised: formally versions the scene composer
surface (`@kiln/engine/composer`, `/composer/agent` -- shipped in 0.1.x without a bump)
plus the fixes below.

### Fixed
- **`auto` consolidation now fires on 4-material assets.** `PALETTE_MIN` dropped 5 → 4,
  aligning the trigger with the instanceability rubric (grade B tops out at 3 materials,
  so 4 is the first grade-C count). Previously a 4-material asset graded C and `auto`
  never consolidated it.
- **Uint32 indices for >65,535-vertex geometry.** `bridgeGeometry` always wrote
  `Uint16Array` indices, silently wrapping values past 65,535 (corrupt GLB). It now
  selects `Uint32Array` when the vertex count exceeds the Uint16 ceiling; the GLB
  writer emits the matching `componentType` (5125).
- **BYOK `apiKey` reaches Anthropic/OpenAI.** `makeKilnModel` dropped `opts.apiKey` on
  the `anthropic` and `openai` branches (only google/openrouter passed it through), so
  BYOK silently fell back to the provider env vars.

### Changed
- Comments in `agent/tools.ts` / `agent/run.ts` updated: the `unified` tool surface is
  the production surface (Kiln Studio runs `KILN_TOOL_SURFACE=unified`), no longer
  "flag-gated until a bench A/B clears it"; `current` remains the library default.

### Housekeeping
- Added the missing `LICENSE` file (MIT, already declared in `package.json`).
- Rewrote the stale `@pixel-forge/core` module headers (`metrics.ts`, `agent/index.ts`,
  `agent/run.ts`, `palette.ts`) to the `@kiln/engine` reality and removed dangling
  references to files that do not exist in this repo.

## [0.1.1] -- 2026-06-30

### Documentation
- Clarified that `@kiln/engine` remains private execution infrastructure. External developer access
  is mediated by Studio `/v1`, private SDK/skills, and future AgentCore Gateway product tools rather
  than direct engine, raw Forge, or composer harness exposure.

### Changed
- Treat native `claude-sonnet-5` as adaptive-only for Anthropic thinking controls: numeric
  `KILN_THINKING` budgets are ignored for this model so the agent harness does not send
  manual extended-thinking params that Sonnet 5 rejects.

### Added -- scene composer (`@kiln/engine/composer`, `/composer/agent`)
A THREE-free scene-composition surface: a `PlacementModel` single-source-of-truth with a
small scene DSL (`scene()`/`asset()`), terrain-agnostic hierarchy-aware layout, an overlap
validator (MTV resolution), a ground sampler, and a `SceneRenderPort`; plus the Strands
agent loop (`runKilnComposer`, 14 `scene_*` tools) isolated under `/composer/agent` so the
SDK never leaks into the pure core. Transcript compaction collapses to `serialize(model)`
past a threshold (the externalized model IS the state), with a soft step-cap backstop and a
`scene_layout`-first prompt so large many-asset scenes converge. ~990 lines of new tests.

> The surface landed without a version bump (Studio consumed it via the committed
> `@kiln/engine` 0.1.0 tarball); formally versioned by the 0.2.0 release above.

## [0.1.0] -- 2026-06-23

Initial extraction of the Kiln 3D engine from `pixel-forge/packages/core/src/kiln`
(source `d396c10`), file history preserved via `git subtree split`.

### Included (the reachable runtime closure of agent/render/palette/views/arena)
- `agent/` Strands agent loop · `arena/` ranking math · `render.ts` GLB bake/grade/optimize/snap/composeScene
- `primitives.ts` · `solids.ts` (CSG) · `ops.ts` · `gears.ts` · `uv.ts`/`uv-shapes.ts` · `textures.ts`
- `validation.ts` (AST) · `inspect.ts` · `metrics.ts` · `palette.ts`/`palette-snap.ts`
- `list-primitives.ts` · `prompt.ts`/`prompt-api.ts` · `tools/registry.ts` · `views/` (CPU rasterizer + PNG)

### Removed vs pixel-forge core/kiln (what makes it lean)
- TIJ pipeline modules `imposter/`, `fbx-ingest/`, `sprite-atlas/`, `retex/`,
  `photogrammetry/`, `lod/` -- the only modules pulling in Playwright + the heavier
  image path.
- Legacy single-shot `generate.ts` (Studio uses the agent path) and the entangled root
  `index.ts` barrel (Studio consumes subpaths, not the barrel).
- Dropped deps: `@anthropic-ai/*`, `@ai-sdk/{anthropic,google,openai}`, `@google/genai`,
  `openai`, `@fal-ai/client`, Vercel `ai`, `playwright`, `meshoptimizer`, `xatlas-three`,
  `@pixel-forge/shared`.

### Retained runtime deps (lazy-loaded)
- `sharp` -- texture decode in `loadTexture` (`await import('sharp')`).
- `xatlasjs` -- UV atlas in `autoUnwrap` (`await import('xatlasjs/dist/node/...')`).

### Tests
- 36 source test files ported (382 pass / 2 skip / 0 fail offline). Live agent tests
  gated behind `KILN_SPIKE_LIVE=1` (off in CI). Dropped: the 6 OUT-module test suites,
  `deps-smoke` (old dep set), `spike`/`top-level-generate` (tested the deleted barrel
  `generate()` wrapper), and `companions`/`refactor-validation` (tested the legacy
  `generate.ts` companion aliases `kiln.editCode`/`kiln.refactor`, also pruned).
- Provider SDKs (`@anthropic-ai/sdk`, `@google/genai`, `openai`, `ai`,
  `@aws-sdk/client-bedrock-runtime`) are **devDependencies only** -- needed to exercise
  the multi-provider `makeKilnModel` factory in `providers.test.ts`; they never enter
  runtime `dependencies`. The kiln-glb skill-drift gate is `skipIf`-guarded (the skill
  lives outside the engine repo).

### Tooling
- **Biome 2.5.1** adopted (lint + format). Source formatted to Biome style (single
  quotes, 2-space, 100-col); `bun run lint` is green. A baseline of 19 stylistic
  warnings (`noExplicitAny`/`useTemplate`/`useOptionalChain`/`noGlobalIsFinite`/…) is
  left visible for a hardening pass; `noNonNullAssertion`/`useLiteralKeys` are off and
  `useIterableCallbackReturn` is warn (all idiomatic in the extracted code).

### Follow-ups (deliberately deferred from WS0 -- see ../plan/03-standards-harness.md)
- Burn down the 19 Biome warnings + re-promote `useIterableCallbackReturn` to error.
- Tighten `tsconfig` (`exactOptionalPropertyTypes`); currently mirrors pixel-forge core
  for a zero-drift green typecheck.
- Consider `tsup` `dist` build + Vitest golden-image render harness (engine ships TS
  source today for drop-in parity with how Studio consumes core).
- Rename the live-test gate `KILN_SPIKE_LIVE` → `KILN_LIVE`.
