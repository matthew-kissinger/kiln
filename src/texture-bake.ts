/**
 * Bake in-memory textures to encoded PNG bytes before export — T2.2
 *
 * ## The problem this closes
 *
 * The GLB bridge (`render.ts` `bridgeTexture`) serializes a texture only if it
 * carries `userData.encoded` — the original bytes `loadTexture` stashed. A
 * texture built in code (a procedural `DataTexture`) has pixels but no encoded
 * bytes, so the bridge returned `null` and the slot was simply left off the
 * material.
 *
 * Measured, before this module existed: a `MeshStandardMaterial` with a
 * hand-built 8x8 checker `map` exported 1912 bytes of valid GLB with **zero
 * warnings**, no image in the file, and a QA disposition of `pass` under
 * `KILN_QA_MODE=off`. The asset shipped looking clean with its texture gone.
 * The scene QA gate does catch it at default settings
 * (`MAT_TEXTURE_DECODE_FAILED`), but that gate is downgradable and it is a
 * *block*, not a bake — it tells an author the texture is unexportable rather
 * than making it exportable.
 *
 * ## What this does
 *
 * Runs before scene QA, so QA judges what will actually be in the file. Every
 * texture reachable from a material slot that has readable 8-bit pixel data and
 * no encoded bytes is encoded to PNG and stamped with the same two `userData`
 * records `loadTexture` writes, so everything downstream — QA, the bridge,
 * provenance — treats a baked texture and a loaded one identically.
 *
 * Anything that cannot be baked gets a warning naming the material, the slot,
 * and the reason. That is the "loud" half: the bridge sees only a `THREE.Texture`
 * and cannot name where it came from, whereas this pass walks slots and can.
 *
 * ## What this deliberately does not do
 *
 * It never sets `texture.colorSpace`. QA requires sRGB for `map`/`emissiveMap`
 * and linear for the data maps, and a hand-built `DataTexture` defaults to
 * linear — but silently reinterpreting an author's pixels is the same class of
 * bug as the silent drop. A procedural albedo with the wrong color space still
 * blocks, with a message that now names the procedural fix.

/**
 * Give every normal-mapped mesh a TANGENT attribute.
 *
 * A glTF material with a normal texture is supposed to ship tangents. Without
 * them the Khronos validator raises `MESH_PRIMITIVE_GENERATED_TANGENT_SPACE`
 * and each runtime invents its own tangent basis, so the same asset lights
 * differently in different engines — the exact failure mode that makes a normal
 * map look right in one viewer and subtly wrong in another.
 *
 * Measured on a procedural crate with a derived normal map: the GLB validated
 * with that warning and no TANGENT accessor until this pass existed. The bridge
 * already exports `geometry.attributes.tangent` when it is present; nothing was
 * ever computing it.
 *
 * Runs only where it is needed — a mesh with no normal map does not pay for it,
 * and the attribute changes the exported bytes, so computing it unconditionally
 * would move every existing textured asset for no benefit.
 *
 * MikkTSpace is the gold standard and glTF's reference basis, but it is a
 * separate WASM package. This engine is vendored into Studio as a tarball and
 * installed into two container images by two different package managers, so a
 * new native/WASM dependency is a real cost there — `computeTangentBasis` below
 * implements the standard per-triangle formulation directly instead. three's
 * own `computeTangents` used the same method before it was removed. If tangent
 * seams ever show on a shipped asset, MikkTSpace is the upgrade path.
