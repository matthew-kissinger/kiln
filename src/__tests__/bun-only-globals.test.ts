/**
 * Bun-only APIs must not reach a `--target=node` bundle, or the shipped source.
 *
 * Ledger 10.3, and it exists because 10.1 shipped undetected for as long as the
 * bundle did. `src/mcp-server.ts` guarded its entry block with `import.meta.main`,
 * which is Bun's. No Bun release lowers it correctly for a Node target: both
 * lowerings observed emit `__require.main == __require.module`, and under Node ESM
 * both sides are `undefined`, so the guard was **always true** and importing the
 * bundle started a live stdio server. Bun 1.4 then stopped emitting the helper the
 * expression referenced, turning it into a startup `ReferenceError` -- which is the
 * only reason anyone found out.
 *
 * The same identifier fails the other way in unbundled shipped source. This
 * package ships `src/**` and a user may run a script with `node` directly; there
 * `import.meta.main` is plainly `undefined`, so an entry guard is always false and
 * the script silently does nothing. `src/experiments/geometry-acceptance.ts` was
 * doing exactly that.
 *
 * Both directions are decided by `isDirectEntry`, from `process.argv[1]` rather
 * than from whatever a bundler makes of `import.meta`.
