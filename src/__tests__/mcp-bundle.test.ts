/**
 * The committed MCP server bundle is the thing every harness actually launches,
 * and it is generated, so it can go stale without anybody noticing until an
 * install fails on someone else's machine. This file is what stops that.
 *
 * Why the bundle exists at all: the manifests used to say `"command": "bun"`,
 * which asks the harness to resolve a name against its own PATH. Bun's installer
 * appends to the Windows *User* PATH, and a process only ever sees the
 * environment it was born with, so anything started before that install looked
 * up `bun`, missed, and died with
 *
 *   kiln: exec: "bun": executable file not found in %PATH%
 *
 * There is not one Bun-specific API on the server's runtime path -- Node strips
 * the types happily and only chokes on this codebase's extensionless imports --
 * so bundling for Node removes Bun from the consumer's requirements entirely.
 * Bun stays the development toolchain; it is no longer a thing users must have.
 *
 * A plugin install is a git clone with no build step, which is why the artifact
 * is committed rather than built on demand.

   * than it looks. Measured on `agy` 1.1.25: it locates `mcp_config.json` at the
   * plugin root -- `agy plugin validate` reports `mcpServers: 1 processed` -- and
   * then does NOT merge it into the session, so `agy mcp list` says
   * `No MCP servers configured` and the agent sees nothing. Registration there

   * expands, because nothing has been observed expanding it.

   * exists.

   * below. It is not a plugin manifest: Claude Code reads it as project-scoped
   * configuration in a plain `git clone`, where no plugin variable is defined at
   * all. It once carried `${PLUGIN_ROOT}`, which only Antigravity intends to
   * expand, so a fresh clone opened onto a `kiln` server that could not start --
