/**
 * The `instructions` field is the only orientation channel that reaches every
 * install shape. A user who configures the server by hand and opens an empty
 * folder has no AGENTS.md, no CLAUDE.md and no registered skills; the skills
 * still ship beside the server, so this text is what tells them so.
 *
 * It names its skills as literal strings, which is what makes it worth testing:
 * a renamed or removed skill directory would leave the server advertising a
 * path that does not exist, and nothing else would notice.
