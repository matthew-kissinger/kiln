/**
 * Part-framed close-up rendering for the Kiln vision loop (kiln_inspect).
 *
 * Renders ONE orthographic view of an executed scene, framed to a named part's
 * world bounds (the part and its descendants) instead of the whole asset, so
 * the agent can inspect a suspect region — a joint, a contact point, a
 * proportion — at full-image detail instead of one grid cell. Part selection is
 * name-driven by design (the model authored the names via createPart), NOT a
 * free camera: an unresolved name comes back with the list of available part
 * names so the model can retry. Surrounding geometry stays visible by default
 * (and may occlude the part from some angles), matching the diagnostic views'
 * focus-bounds framing model (see ./diagnostic.ts); `isolate` opts out of that
 * and hides everything outside the part so nothing can block the view.
