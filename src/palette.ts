/**
 * Kiln canonical material palette — the single source of truth for the
 * "Optimized palette" authoring directive (Move 2) and a future shared palette
 * texture (Phase C, cross-asset batching).
 *
 * PURE DATA + a text helper. NO `three`, NO node, NO gltf-transform imports — so
 * it is browser-safe and can be consumed anywhere (the leaf subpath
 * `@kiln/engine/palette`) without dragging runtime code into a bundle.
 *
 * Why it lives in the engine: the palette is the shared contract both the
 * authoring prompt (instruct the model to build against these roles) and a later
 * bake-time shared-palette texture (Phase C) target. The slot SET + ORDER are
 * stable so the future texture is deterministic; the implementer may tune
 * individual color / metalness / roughness values without breaking that contract.
 *
 * The rendered directive string was mirrored verbatim in the Kiln Studio product's `shared/`
 * module as `OPTIMIZED_PALETTE_DIRECTIVE` (so that import-free, browser-critical
 * module stays dependency-free); a parity test in kiln-studio asserts the two
 * never drift.
