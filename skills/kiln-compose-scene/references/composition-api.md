# Composition API notes

Use these through the destination project's TypeScript toolchain. `inspectGlbIntegration` and `composeSceneGLB` are exported from `@kiln/engine/render`; overlap helpers are exported from `@kiln/engine/composer`. Generated Kiln source itself still has no imports.

```ts
const composed = await composeSceneGLB([
  { name: 'MarketStall', bytes: stallBytes,
    transform: { pos: [2,0,1], rotDeg: [0,90,0], scale: [1,1,1] } },
  { name: 'Lamp', bytes: lampBytes,
    transform: { pos: [3,0,1], rotDeg: [0,0,0], scale: [1,1,1] } },
], { sceneName: 'Market', optimize: 'off', keepAnimations: false });
```

`pos` uses metres; `rotDeg` is Euler XYZ degrees; `scale` is a three-component scale. The result includes `bytes`, `tris`, `draws`, `materials`, `warnings`, and the final GLB validation report. A corrupt part may be skipped with a warning rather than fail the whole export.

The default optimizer is `palette`; `off` is useful when first checking authored material fidelity. `keepAnimations` defaults to false. Set it true only when the scene should retain asset clips and then verify their playback.

Call `inspectGlbIntegration(bytes)` for actual bounds and integration metadata. It may return `undefined`; do not invent a manifest for an empty/unusable input.

`findOverlaps(boxes, options)` returns candidate AABB intersections; `isOverlapFree` returns a boolean, and `summarizeOverlaps(violations)` formats findings. Options select `mode: 'footprint'` (default, ignores Y) or `'volume'`, with optional tolerance. Use world-space boxes and stable instance IDs. Footprint checks are insufficient for stacked or overhead objects.

The simpler `worldAabbFromLocal` path assumes uniform scale and Y rotation. For arbitrary rotated/nonuniform placements, compute world bounds from all eight local corners with the full transform rather than forcing that shape into a narrower helper.
