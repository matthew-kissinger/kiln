# Verify an asset for its intended use

Match the checks to the requested delivery. A source build, an image review, a GLB export, and a working asset in a game are different pieces of evidence.

## Before integration

Read the [export profile guide](references/export-profiles.md) when reviewing delivery files. Verify the selected converter separately from the editable/runtime profile. Runtime GLBs must preserve native playback without the sidecar; provenance checks use the sidecar filename and exact byte hash. Keep the canonical editable asset for source and full Kiln review data, and measure actual loading and rendering performance separately.

Read validation/build findings and export warnings. `kiln_validate` only checks source; render and inspect the actual geometry when that is the task. Choose broad or part-specific views that reveal the suspected defect. Copy the returned `programRef` exactly for every view, whether it is a short `p_` handle or a full SHA-256 reference; request source text only when a repair needs it. A handle identifies a revision in its store; use full source and artifact hashes for integrity evidence.

Distinguish expected open sheets from invalid solid topology. `geometryDiagnostics` reports boundary edges, non-manifold edges, orientation conflicts and degenerates; it does not prove absence of self-intersection. A capped loft, shell-like surface, or sampled field is not automatically a manufacturing-grade solid.

For an assembly, identify the required contact pairs and the required separation
pairs. Review both ends of supports against their intended neighbors with focused
views and `kiln_inspect` surface measurements, following intermediate fittings
back to the body. A supported cable can end at an unmounted fitting; a bar can
touch one neighbor while its other end floats. Review named separation findings
against those intended connections even when other contact checks pass. Zero surface distance
can mean intersection; it is appropriate evidence for neither a required gap
nor a sound mechanical fitting by itself. Select the actual interface parts,
not the entire assembly. Report unmeasured joints explicitly.

Read `capture.backdrop` in image results: views are on a neutral grey unless a capture asked for `dark` or `light`, and a silhouette judged on the wrong assumption about the backdrop is not evidence. Check material and camera fidelity independently. A fallback image may still answer a geometry question, but it cannot establish faithful PBR appearance. Keep unresolved export or material findings visible in the delivery report.

## In the destination

For Blender, Unity or FBX, read the [engine handoff guide](references/engine-handoff.md) before choosing import settings or trying the experimental exporter. Check the actual target importer and render pipeline; a successful Kiln preview alone does not establish destination compatibility.

Use the project's existing loader and renderer. Read the [integration checks](references/integration-checks.md) for manifests, frames, composition options, and limits.

Confirm scale alongside existing objects, forward direction, ground contact, placement, and useful viewing distance. Check textures and lighting in the destination renderer. Exercise relevant animation, interaction, and collision; sample intermediate poses when checking motion. For web projects use the actual browser view, and for native projects use the destination runtime.

Animation review returns `poseBounds` in world metres for each requested phase,
including the selected subject when a shot names one. Compare those bounds with
the requested ground plane or movement envelope. These measure drawable geometry
before camera isolation, not physical contacts or a continuous swept volume.
Repeated geometry needs phases inside a repeat as well as between keys: quarter
turns of a 16-lug wheel all show the same alignment. Include irregular phases
and inspect the moving subject; identical sampled bounds do not prove constant
ground clearance. Report the range actually measured.

For a requested repeating animation, also read `loopClosure`. It measures local
translation, quaternion orientation and scale at zero and the clip duration,
independently of selected image phases. `open` identifies endpoint gaps; `incomplete`
cannot certify closure. Quaternion sign changes alone are not gaps. A one-shot
opening or attack need not return to its initial pose. `closed` establishes only
endpoint continuity, not smooth velocity, convincing motion or working contacts.

For several moving contacts or attachments, pass `measureParts` with up to 16
exact `{name}` or `{path}` selectors. Each phase returns `poseBounds.parts` in
that order, independently of the camera; empty subtrees have `bounds:null`.
Check the intended contact parts together. A low scene minimum can come from a
floor or one foot and says nothing about the others; lack of penetration does
not establish support. Bounds still do not prove balance, friction or contact.
CLI uses `--measure-parts parts.json` with the same selector array.

Reproduce defects before fixing them. Correct placement/loader/lighting problems in integration code; change asset source for a geometry or rig defect. Recheck the affected behavior after a repair.

Report the exact artifacts tested, what you ran and saw, repaired defects, and checks left unperformed. Validation, `visualQa: not_assessed`, an AABB overlap test, or a low triangle count is not a substitute for visual or runtime verification.
