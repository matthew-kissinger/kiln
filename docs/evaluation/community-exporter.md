# Community exporter qualification

The candidate exporter is experimental. The existing production exporter remains the default until
the exporter and its downstream processing pass structural, visual, packaging, and real-consumer
checks. Passing glTF validation alone does not prove that authored features survived export.

## Repeatable existing-asset corpus

Run from the repository root with the pinned Bun toolchain:

```powershell
bun scripts/integration-corpus.mjs --self-test
bun scripts/integration-corpus.mjs --out tmp/exporter-corpus/baseline
$env:KILN_GLTF_EXPORTER = 'three'
bun scripts/integration-corpus.mjs --out tmp/exporter-corpus/candidate --compare tmp/exporter-corpus/baseline
Remove-Item Env:KILN_GLTF_EXPORTER
```

The runner exports every `examples/*.kiln.js` source twice with optimization disabled. Use `--input`
for a separate authoring workspace, `--filter` for a filename substring, or `--limit` for a smoke run.
It invokes no image renderer and no live model. Corpus geometry export is independent of CPU/GPU
view rendering; use GPU rendering in the separate visual qualification.

Each output directory contains the retained GLBs, source and output SHA-256 hashes, semantic
signatures, and an incrementally written `results.json`. A failure, nondeterministic repeat, or
signature difference causes a nonzero exit status. A missing baseline is an error, not a pass.
Run the baseline with the default exporter before enabling the candidate. Output hashes establish
repeatability within a backend; different binary hashes across exporters are expected and are not
used as the compatibility verdict.

Signatures cover named hierarchy paths, local/world matrices, undeformed world bounds, vertex
attributes, index topology, morph targets, skin joints and inverse bind matrices, node extras,
material assignments and core PBR factors, decoded texture pixels, extension names, and animation
channel targets/keyframes. Numeric arrays are rounded to six decimal places. The built-in self-test
checks serialization invariance and detects transform corruption, material changes, and vertex
changes that leave bounding boxes unchanged.

### Interpretation limits

- Differences need classification. Equivalent primitive reordering or deduplication can produce
  differences, while extension presence alone does not prove every extension parameter survived.
- This is a static structural comparison. It does not evaluate skin deformation, sampled animation,
  shader fidelity, texture sampling/UV transforms, material-variant mapping, or GPU instancing.
- PNG/JPEG texture pixels are decoded. KTX2/Draco/meshopt packaging is outside this uncompressed
  interchange corpus and needs a codec-aware qualification suite.
- Every source receives a generic prop intent so that the exporter comparison uses identical
  settings. These results are not category-specific authoring QA certification.
- Existing examples supplement focused fixtures and independently authored dogfood. They do not
  establish support for features absent from the corpus or prove imports in every engine.

## Baseline evidence

The unchanged main checkout completed `bun run test` on 2026-09-15 UTC: **1,943 passed, 4 skipped,
0 failed**, across 221 files, in 125.10 seconds. Skips were Windows permissions/symlink checks and
two pre-existing generated-skill checks. Local log:
`C:/Users/Mattm/X/kiln-oss/tmp/exporter-corpus/baseline-tests.log`.

Candidate evidence must be recorded separately from this unchanged-main baseline. No release
conclusion follows from the baseline alone.

The initial default-exporter corpus completed all **86 existing example sources**, each exported
twice: **172 exports, no failures, all byte-repeatable**. Retained evidence is under
`tmp/exporter-corpus/baseline/` in the migration worktree. This run began before the candidate
integration was loaded; subsequent candidate runs compare semantic signatures against these files.

## Initial candidate and default-preservation results

On the migration branch, both the explicit `legacy` backend and experimental `three` backend
completed all 86 sources twice (344 additional exports), with no export failures and byte-identical
repeats within each backend.

- **Branch legacy:** all 86 semantic signatures and all 86 GLB SHA-256 hashes match the
  pre-integration baseline exactly. This includes the shared extension-registration change.
- **Candidate:** 45 signatures match exactly; 41 show material changes. Across the corpus the only
  reported difference categories are material-extension presence (500 per-material entries and 41
  document-level extension lists) and eight roughness values for unlit materials in `crawler-crane`.
  Forty affected assets gain `KHR_materials_emissive_strength`; `crawler-crane` gains
  `KHR_materials_unlit`.
  Their legacy fallback roughness was 1; the community export uses 0.9 plus `KHR_materials_unlit`.
- **No observed structural differences:** named hierarchy, local/world transforms, undeformed bounds,
  vertex attributes, index topology, animation channels, node extras, and decoded texture data match
  wherever those features occur in these examples. This does not establish coverage of all features.

These material changes preserve authored features absent from the legacy conversion, but they are
still appearance changes that need GPU/consumer qualification. They must not be silently relabeled
as exact parity. Retained results are `tmp/exporter-corpus/candidate/results.json` and
`tmp/exporter-corpus/branch-default/results.json`. The comparison command intentionally reports a
nonzero status when these differences exist; manual classification is recorded here separately.

## Browser qualification

The first direct browser bundle attempt exposed native Node dependencies reachable through the
candidate exporter (sharp and the native canvas library). The candidate now accepts an injected
host platform, with native browser decoding as its default. After that boundary change, a direct
browser bundle of `communitySceneDocument` and its fixture built successfully with no Node shims.

An isolated headless Chrome session executed raw RGBA and encoded PNG texture fixtures, each with a
named pivot and quaternion animation, twice. Both cases preserved exact decoded pixels, the animation
channel, and private-metadata filtering, and repeated byte-identically. Both final GLBs passed
Khronos validation with zero errors. An actual WebGL draw reported **ANGLE NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070,
Direct3D11**, with software renderers explicitly rejected by the probe.

Local reproduction/evidence: `tmp/browser-export-audit/browser.ts`, `run.cjs`,
`browser-results.json`, `browser-{raw,encoded}.glb`, `verified.json`, and `browser-gpu.png`.
Each browser GLB was also reimported with Three.js GLTFLoader. GPU readbacks of the original and
reimported scenes at animation times 0, 0.5, and 1 second matched byte-for-byte for both texture
cases (six comparisons, maximum/mean channel differences both zero). This establishes parity for
the small textured cube/pivot fixtures, not the entire material portfolio or complete browser
authoring support.

## CLI worker qualification finding

The first Node 22.23.2 bundled CLI comparison found two boundary problems: a cache entry generated by
the legacy exporter was reused for the candidate request, and disabling the build cache still
produced legacy bytes because the sanitized worker environment did not carry the experimental
selection. These runs establish the legacy CLI baseline only. Candidate CLI acceptance requires
explicit worker configuration and exporter-specific cache identity, followed by a fresh test of the
rebuilt package. Environment selection in a parent process alone is not evidence of the worker's
actual exporter.

After those fixes, `scripts/exporter-cli-check.mjs` exercises the actual bundled entry point with
one textured, emissive, animated fixture in a fresh temporary workspace. Both exporters share one
disk cache directory. It requires a distinct first-build key and distinct GLB hash for each backend,
then requires each second run to hit its own key and return identical bytes. Run it with the
supported Node executable (or pass `--node <absolute-executable>`); it does not install a runtime or
rebuild the package. It prints and retains a receipt with runtime version and exact CLI bundle hash.

The gate passed on **Node 22.23.2** for CLI SHA-256
`a689760533a77bca67680512411e63104bf6b18d4c14b03d6d50d3e5fdda9bc5`.
Separately, the same bundle exported a procedural-texture fixture and the existing `robot-arm`
asset through both backends, twice each, with distinct backend keys and successful own-cache hits.
All eight outputs repeated within their backend; the four unique outputs passed Khronos validation
with zero errors. The robot retained five textures, one animation, and eight animation channels.
Texture-fixture signatures match; the robot differs only by two preserved emissive-strength
material extensions. Evidence: `tmp/browser-export-audit/final-verified.json` and
`reusable-cli-check.log`. These are Windows bundled-entry checks with installed repository
dependencies, not clean-install tests on other operating systems.

The final source snapshot was also rerun through both complete 86-asset corpora after worker/cache
changes: **344 exports, all deterministic, no export failures**. Final default signatures and GLB
hashes still match all 86 baseline assets exactly. Final candidate differences remain the same
41 material-only cases classified above. Evidence: `tmp/exporter-corpus/final-default/results.json`
and `tmp/exporter-corpus/final-candidate/results.json`.

### Rebuilt candidate identity

After the unmatched-animation diagnostic regression was fixed, the bundled CLI cache gate was
rerun on Node 22.23.2. It passed again with build identity
`5ab4a924cbcac4120e3e00de43416d42d284535e6259d028cb642c9dcb180dfb`
and verified CLI SHA-256
`c2119cae8205f047c0afce084a22a0aeb47415ad193715cad2f0c762ea2d384c`.
Both backend fixture hashes remain unchanged from the previous successful check, and each backend
created its own disk-cache key and reused it on its second invocation. Receipt:
`tmp/browser-export-audit/release-candidate-cli-check.log`.

Both complete corpora were rerun after that last fix: `release-candidate-default` and
`release-candidate-three` each contain 86 successful, deterministic cases (344 exports total).
Every semantic signature and every GLB hash matches the corresponding prior `final-default` or
`final-candidate` run. The advisory fix changes none of these valid existing-asset outputs.

## Release decision

### Authored-asset qualification

Four fresh OpenCode Muse Spark 1.3 Contributor Free assets exercised CLI creation, GPU review,
targeted edits and same-path output replacement: a sailing vane, textured coolant pump,
transparent compass and folding solar assembly. Initial author sessions used legacy conversion
because the subprocess did not receive the experimental selection. This was detected, corrected
with bounded host-option transport and cache separation, and rechecked; the initial sessions are
workflow evidence, not candidate-conversion evidence.

After that fix, all four sources were exported through both backends with the packaged Node
22.23.2 subprocess CLI and GPU8017/Dawn D3D12 on RTX3070. Sailing and assembly image comparisons
were byte-identical. Mean RGB differences were approximately 0.06015/255 for industrial and
0.01161/255 for instrument; maximum channel differences were 9 and 8. Both instrument views
show the same overly milky cover, so asset art quality is not represented as fully accepted.
An additional bounded Muse session made a targeted pennant edit with two actual candidate GPU
reviews and repeated same-path export. Author source snapshots and tool/renderer receipts were
retained outside the checkout.

Blender 5.2.0 LTS and Unity 6000.2.3f1 Built-in RP/glTFast 6.20.0 imported the four actual packaged
candidate GLBs and passed source-derived pivot, material and sampled-motion expectations.
Unity's static-root filename policy was identified and recorded as an importer-specific mapping.
A built Windows Unity player ran these assets using Direct3D11 on RTX3070: 189 renderers, zero
unsupported/error shaders, and three intended joints moving through native Playables.

The separate technical corpus also imported twelve comparison GLBs into both applications,
covering colours, extra UVs, morphs, skin data, materials and clips. These receipts establish the
tested features only. They do not establish every shader extension, skin deformation, runtime
downloaded GLB shader inclusion, other Unity pipelines, or clean installations on every OS.

### Bugs found during qualification

- Explicit exporter selection was missing from worker transport and disk cache identity.
- Export texture clones shared their image source with the author scene.
- Community conversion bypassed legacy material-group partition validation.
- Transformed `THREE.Scene` roots needed a named Group representation.
- Unresolved advisory tracks could become invalid empty native glTF animations.
- Browser conversion needed a host-injected decode boundary instead of Node dependencies.

Each behavior correction has targeted coverage or a repeatable integration gate. The adapter
continues to reject unsupported lines/points explicitly and to filter metadata on export copies.

### Decision

The final local gate passed 1,961 tests with four intentional skips and zero failures.
Coverage was 95.18% of functions and 92.83% of lines, above the unchanged 94.00% and 92.10%
thresholds. Toolchain, skill checks, typecheck, lint, and all 45 render-service tests passed.
The final packaged Node 22.23.2 subprocess CLI reproduced all five reviewed dogfood GLBs
byte-for-byte. The existing exporter remains the default; this branch does not approve a
production rollout or a default-backend switch. Hosted CI results are reported on the PR.

Keep the default unchanged if any required qualification is incomplete or an unexplained
regression remains. Required evidence includes the complete engine gates, supported-platform
packaging, independently authored CLI dogfood with GPU reviews, actual Three.js/Blender/Unity
imports, animation and material checks, and a Unity player build. The engine/importer/version/render
pipeline combination must be named in results rather than claiming universal engine support.

## Expanded qualification and unified migration

The opt-in backend supports explicit experimental comparisons. The normal CLI/MCP schema is
unchanged; user and agent handoff documentation explains when testing the candidate is useful,
how to restore the default, and what remains unsupported. The target is one default implementation
after the migration gates pass, not a permanent two-exporter product.

### Additional executable evidence

- `src/__tests__/exporter-deformation.test.ts` samples combined skin and morph motion before
  export and after GLTFLoader reload, both before and after the full optimization request.
  Nonzero deformation must match at four sample times, within 1e-5 world units.
- Physical-material tests assert actual clearcoat, transmission, volume, IOR, specular, sheen,
  iridescence and anisotropy factors before/after palette rewriting, not just extension names.
- Clean npm package checks require a textured candidate export through the real subprocess,
  decoded checker pixels, named pivot and animation, double-sided material, native canvas,
  and Khronos validation. Emissive strength proves selection reached the worker. These checks
  run in the existing Linux, Windows and both macOS architecture package jobs.
- `scripts/integration/run-browser-export.mjs` exercises real GPU rendering of source versus
  exported/reimported scenes. `generate-deformation-fixtures.ts` and its expectation manifest
  provide repeatable evaluated-deformation fixtures for the Blender/Unity adapters.

### Additional gaps found and corrected

The installed Three.js exporter ignores texture centers and manual UV matrices, and serializes
Three's texture scale/rotation fields despite the differing multiplication order used by glTF.
GPU comparison exposed the resulting placement error. The adapter now derives glTF-order TRS
from the effective matrix on an export copy and checks that reconstruction is accurate. It
rejects matrices with shear or perspective instead of silently changing their appearance.
Uniform scale with rotated center and representable manual matrices are covered separately.
The first center-only test was insufficient because it reconstructed Three's matrix order;
that oracle was corrected and the GPU comparison remains independent.

The exporter also ignores the separate Three.js sheen intensity. The adapter folds that
intensity into the cloned sheen color, matching Three's actual renderer and glTF's single color
factor. A focused test first failed on the missing intensity, then passed through export and
palette rewrite. Sprite conversion now retains authored material names as well.

### Remaining default-switch gate

A diagnostic engine run with `KILN_GLTF_EXPORTER=three` identified tests tied to historical
serialization and legacy-only attribute limitations, in addition to the real sprite naming
issue. That run occurred while qualification tests/source were being edited and is not a
release gate. Before a default switch, run the whole suite on a frozen build, classify each
remaining difference, and keep historical byte fixtures explicit rather than silently accepting
new snapshots. Low-level subprocess tests must compare the same explicit backend.

Lossless handling of sheared texture transforms still needs a qualified implementation or an
upstream solution. UV baking affects texture coordinate channels, shared materials and normal-map
tangents, so it cannot be treated as an unchecked offset patch. No default switch is approved by
this revision. Remaining advanced extensions, compression codecs and additional consumer/render
pipelines require their own feature evidence; this report does not claim universal support.

### Measured expanded results

The expanded browser GPU gate passed eight supported fixtures and 25 pixel-exact source/reimport
comparisons on Chrome 152 / RTX 3070, with maximum deformed-vertex delta 1.49e-8. Three sheared-UV
fixtures assert explicit rejection and are not counted as supported exports. The sheen fixture
also includes a visibly different sheen-disabled control.

Real Blender 5.2 / Unity 6000.2 Built-in RP imports measured 0.538516 m skin displacement and
0.600000 m morph displacement, matching independent fixture expectations. A separate Windows
Unity player on RTX 3070 / Direct3D11 measured skin/morph silhouette changes across rendered
frames with zero shader errors. The double-sided sheet produced 8,742 foreground pixels from
both sides; its one-sided control produced 8,742 front and zero back. The reusable runner records
input GLB, helper script and Unity package-lock hashes. Exact end-of-loop samples were avoided,
and animation samples use separate frames because Unity caches GPU skinning within a frame.

Local coverage after runtime fixes: 1,967 passed, four skipped, zero failed; functions 95.18%,
lines 92.83%, above unchanged thresholds. The final CLI hash is
`1ec303580d5452a0b3e2f3f9be6ccab3cd1b6acc21d1a2529b888efd48fc63d8`, runtime identity
`7c4545f115e22467ba52185f40560683229fcc52bb545cff29856a9cf830f4c9`.
All five final authored dogfood exports reproduce the prior reviewed GLBs byte-for-byte on this
build. Hosted clean-package candidate checks and the candidate-selected engine suite are now
part of the PR gates; their per-revision results are attached to the PR.

The community route for the remaining UV case is an accessor-level UV bake using glTF Transform,
with copies when shared mesh data requires different mappings. This is described by the maintainer
in [discussion #1095](https://github.com/donmccurdy/glTF-Transform/discussions/1095).
A future implementation should reuse those document/accessor APIs and qualify multiple texture
slots, shared meshes and normal maps with the existing GPU fixtures. It should not fork the
exporter or alter canonical geometry silently. The normal-map convention boundary also has
[upstream discussion](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/22165); checking installed exporter
behavior remains necessary even when an upstream issue is marked closed.

### Final frozen revision

After the resource-name fix, the runtime identity is
`413501ff069d991b8be09cdbabc57c8ca2333179bc67288e2c33eca586959ef8` and CLI SHA-256 is
`9e7e7fc81233f4bb34584eabfa5a82a82f5c0f636965ec0f3b78872df5c539ed`.
The final default coverage gate passed 1,967 tests, four skips, zero failures, with functions
95.18% and lines 92.83%. The final browser gate again passed all 25 pixel comparisons.
Clean npm installation of the final tarball passed on Node 22.23.2/npm 12.0.2 with the installed
CLI hash verified. Four dogfood GLBs remain byte-identical; the industrial asset differs only by
two restored image names (`CastBluePaint`, `CastBlueNormal`), with an identical BIN chunk.
No geometry, encoded image bytes or shader values changed in that artifact.

Historical architecture experiment hashes are now explicitly pinned to their original legacy
converter; they were not regenerated to bless candidate differences. Unsupported-attribute
policy tests use a genuinely unsupported custom attribute instead of newly supported colors/UVs.
Subprocess parity tests cover both explicit backends. Texture round-trip tests compare decoded
pixels rather than encoder-dependent PNG lengths, and cache tests use matching host settings.
These changes preserve each assertion's purpose when the candidate is selected.

The final frozen suite with `KILN_GLTF_EXPORTER=three` also passed **1,967 tests**, four skips and
zero failures. CI now repeats that suite on Linux in addition to the default coverage gate and
the explicit-backend packaged worker/cache checks.
