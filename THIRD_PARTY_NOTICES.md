# Third-party notices

Kiln uses dependencies under their own licenses. Their package license files remain part
of the installed dependency tree. The optional renderer uses `webgpu` 0.6.1; it is resolved
as a dependency, not repacked or stripped. Its distributed `LICENSE.md` contains the Dawn
and Tint notice below. This notice is reproduced from the pinned installed artifact; npm's
short license metadata is not a replacement for that file.

## Candidate native/WASM dependency inventory

Inspected September 23, 2026. Runtime bundles keep npm dependencies external;
installation retains their own package files and notices. This table identifies
the native/WASM packages used by this candidate, not a replacement license for
their transitive components. Optional Strands/provider dependencies are separate
and are not required for CLI/MCP authoring.

| Package inspected | Package license metadata | Distributed notice / provenance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `webgpu@0.6.1` | MIT metadata; distributed Dawn/Tint notice is BSD-3-Clause | `webgpu/LICENSE.md`, reproduced above; native Dawn/Tint supplied by the package |
| `@napi-rs/canvas@1.0.9` | MIT | `@napi-rs/canvas/LICENSE`; platform package contains the Skia-based native binding |
| `sharp@0.35.4` | Apache-2.0 | `sharp/LICENSE` |
| `@img/sharp-win32-x64@0.35.4` | Apache-2.0 AND LGPL-3.0-or-later | package `LICENSE` and `versions.json`; the inspected binary includes libvips 8.18.6 and additional native libraries |
| `manifold-3d@3.5.3` | Apache-2.0 | `manifold-3d/LICENSE`, JavaScript and WASM distribution |
| `xatlasjs@0.2.0` | MIT | `xatlasjs/LICENSE`, copyright Jonathan Young; JavaScript and WASM distribution |

Sharp selects platform-specific binaries during installation; consult the
[upstream installation documentation](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/install/)
and the exact installed platform package. A Windows receipt does not inventory
another platform's native artifacts. If distributing a self-contained archive
with dependencies, retain their license files and complete that archive's native
notice/source inventory before publication. Kiln's npm tarball does not embed
these native binaries. Full standalone-binary redistribution is not qualified by
this inventory.
