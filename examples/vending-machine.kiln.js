// A Japanese street vending machine, at night.

// Authored by: Claude Opus 5, via Claude Code. Every part below was written by
// the model itself, looking at its own renders through the Kiln tools and
// revising. Not a line of it is hand-authored.
//
// This is the EMISSIVE example, and the thing it exists to demonstrate is the
// rule that keeps catching people out:
//
//   EMISSIVE AREA IS THE ENEMY OF SHAPE.
//
// There is no global illumination here. An emissive surface does not light the
// room, it only makes its own pixels bright -- so a large panel at a high
// intensity does not read as "a glowing sign", it reads as a white rectangle
// with nothing in it, and anything standing in front of it is a black
// silhouette against a blown-out ground. The first pass of this file ran the
// display backlight at intensity 2.4 across 0.76 x 0.62 m and every bottle in
// the machine disappeared into it.
//
// So the emissive here is allocated the other way round:
//
//   large area, LOW intensity   the display backlight, which only has to be
//                               brighter than the cabinet around it
//   small area, HIGH intensity  the price tags, the button LEDs, the two neon
//                               tubes -- narrow enough that clipping to white
//                               is what you want, because that is what a real
//                               tube does to a camera
//
// and the contrast that sells all of it comes from the DARK: near-black bezel,
// near-black mullions between the columns, a black delivery port. Put a bright
// thing next to a black thing and the bright thing glows. Put it next to
// another bright thing and you have a lightbox.
//
// The second rule this asset is built on is that the machine is a FACE. Every
// element is on a declared plane measured forward from the cabinet front, and
// the ones a customer touches -- buttons, coin slot, the flap -- stand proud of
// the ones they only look at. A vending machine modelled flat looks like a
// poster of a vending machine.
//
// Known limit: no text anywhere. proceduralTexture has no text op, so the
// price tags are colour fields, the brand banner is a stripe, and the hot/cold
// labels are the red and blue bands they sit on rather than the words. At asset
// scale that reads correctly -- Japanese machines really do code hot and cold
// by colour first -- but it would not survive a close-up.

  // it at all, and against three lit columns that reads as a hole in the model
  // rather than as a sold-out slot. The asymmetry that actually works is the one
  // that is still here: cans in column 1, bottles in the other three.
