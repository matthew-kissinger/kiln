// A Gothic cathedral, at dusk, with the lamps lit inside.
//
// Authored by: Claude Opus 5, via Claude Code. Every part below was written by
// the model itself, looking at its own renders through the Kiln tools and
// revising. Not a line of it is hand-authored.
//
// This is the REPETITION example, and it is here because a cathedral is the
// thing a code-first modeller is actually better at than a mouse.
//
// A Gothic building is not a collection of unique shapes. It is one bay,
// resolved once and then repeated with variation: pier, window, flyer,
// pinnacle, cornice, repeat. Every real one was built that way, from templates
// held by a master mason, because that is the only way a workshop of four
// hundred people builds a coherent object over eighty years. In a viewport you
// copy-paste geometry and then discover, three hundred copies later, that the
// sill height was wrong. Written down, the sill height is a number in one
// place. Move BAY and the windows, the piers, the flyers and the pinnacles all
// move with it, because none of them knows where it is -- each one is told.
//
// Three things make this read as a cathedral rather than as a shed with
// pointed windows:
//
//   1. THE ARCH IS EQUILATERAL. Both arcs of a lancet are struck from the
//      opposite springing point at a radius equal to the full span. That is not
//      a stylistic choice, it is the compass construction, and it means an
//      arch's height is not a free parameter -- it falls out of its width, at
//      w * sqrt(3)/2. Every opening here obeys it, which is why they all look
//      like they belong to the same building.
//   2. THE BUTTRESSING IS STRUCTURAL. The flyers land on the clerestory wall
//      where the vault pushes, and the pinnacles are not ornament -- they are
//      dead weight stacked on the pier head to turn the flyer's diagonal thrust
//      down into the pier. That relationship is most of what separates a
//      cathedral silhouette from a castle silhouette.
//   3. THE WEST FRONT IS SYMMETRIC AND THE REST OF THE BUILDING IS NOT. A
//      facade faces the city and the two towers are a pair, so they match:
//      Cologne, Westminster and Notre-Dame all read as one composition for
//      that reason. Two earlier passes here tried to buy character by making
//      the towers differ -- first by leaving one unbuilt with a crane on it,
//      then by giving one a taller crocketed spire and the other a plain lead
//      pyramid. Both produced a building with a good half and a bad half, and
//      the eye goes straight to the bad half every time. Asymmetry has to come
//      from the PLAN instead, where it costs nothing: the crossing fleche
//      stands off the tower axis, the apse is only at the east end, and the
//      aisle bays run a rhythm the front never repeats.
//
// Lighting: it is dusk and the building is lit from inside, so the glass is the
// only emissive thing here. The windows are a small fraction of the elevation,
// so they run HOT -- small area, high intensity, the rule the vending machine
// example sets out. The rose is the exception. It is nearly 8 m across, so it
// runs cooler and takes its punch from the black tracery laid over it.
//
// Known limit: no interior. Every mass is solid and every opening is a recess
// cut about a metre into it with glass at the back. From outside that is the
// same picture as a modelled interior for a fraction of the triangles; walk the
// camera through the west door and there is nothing in there.
