// A six-axis industrial robot arm.
//
// Authored by: Claude Opus 5, via Claude Code. Every part below was written by
// the model itself, looking at its own renders through the Kiln tools and
// revising. Not a line of it is hand-authored.
//
// This is the ANIMATION example, and the reason it is an arm rather than
// something with one moving part is that a robot is the case where the rig is
// the asset. Six joints, each one hanging off the last, and the only thing the
// animation says is what angle each joint is at. Every position in the clip
// below falls out of that chain -- there is not one world-space coordinate in
// `animate()`, because there cannot be: the tool flange's position is whatever
// five joints upstream of it decided, and if a link length changes here the
// whole cycle still works.
//
// That is the difference between a rig and a set of moving parts. The beam
// engine this replaced solved its linkage numerically and then drove five parts
// with five separate answers; break one and the mechanism comes apart on
// screen. Here the parts cannot come apart, because none of them knows where it
// is.
//
// The chain, shoulder outward, is the standard 6R wrist-partitioned layout:
//
//   J1 waist    about Y   the whole robot swings
//   J2 shoulder about Z   upper arm pitches
//   J3 elbow    about Z   forearm pitches
//   J4 roll     about Y   forearm rotates about its own axis
//   J5 wrist    about Z   tool pitches
//   J6 flange   about Y   tool rotates about its own axis
//
// Axes alternate perpendicular / parallel in exactly that pattern on every
// articulated arm ever built, because it is what puts three axes through one
// point at the wrist and makes the inverse kinematics solvable in closed form.
// Nothing here solves IK, but getting the axis assignment right is what makes
// the motion read as a robot instead of as a puppet.
//
// Proportions are off a mid-size floor-standing arm in the 1.5 m / 20 kg class
// -- a Fanuc M-20 or an ABB IRB 1600. The tell on those is not the arm, it is
// the COUNTERWEIGHT: a mass hung behind the shoulder so J2 is not fighting the
// whole arm at every angle. Robots that do not have it look like toys, and the
// first pass of this file did not have it and did.
//
// Verified by walking the clip and reading the tool flange's world position
// rather than by looking at it, because "the arm reaches down" is exactly the
// kind of claim a 3/4 render will let you get away with being wrong about. It
// was: the first pass's pick pose put the flange at y = 1.231 against a home of
// y = 1.088, so the robot reached UP to pick and the six-frame filmstrip looked
// entirely convincing doing it. Corrected, the cycle now reads
//
//   home 1.088 -> pick 0.616 -> lift 1.214 -> traverse 1.251
//        -> place 0.661 -> withdraw 1.214 -> home 1.088
//
// and returns to (1.109, 1.088, 0.135) at t = DUR, bit for bit the pose it
// started in, so the clip loops without a jump. All 8 tracks bind.
//
// Known limit: the dress pack is rigid. On a real arm the cable loop between
// the base and the upper arm flexes through the whole cycle, and doing that
// properly needs the conduit re-solved per keyframe. Everything that moves here
// is parented to exactly one link, so the loop lives on the forearm where one
// link's motion carries it honestly, and the base cable stops at the turret.
