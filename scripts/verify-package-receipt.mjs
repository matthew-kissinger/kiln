/**
 * Check one platform's package-smoke receipt against what the release claims.
 *
 * This lived as a ~400 character `node -e` one-liner inside the macOS job, which was
 * tolerable at one platform and is not at four: the expected platform differs per job,
 * so triplicating it means three chances to assert `darwin` on a Linux runner and have
 * the receipt pass anyway. A receipt that cannot fail is not evidence.
 *
 * The expected Node and npm versions are read from `engines` rather than written here,
 * so `check-toolchain.mjs` stays the single source for them. `engineVersion` is checked
 * against `package.json` for the same reason a release attaches these files at all --
 * a receipt that does not name the version it exercised cannot be matched to a tarball.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/verify-package-receipt.mjs --platform linux --arch x64
 *   node scripts/verify-package-receipt.mjs --platform win32 --arch x64 --receipt r.json
