/**
 * Audit the gallery images that live in R2 rather than in git history.
 *
 * The counterpart to `scripts/upload-posters.mjs`: that script publishes and
 * refuses to void a receipt, this one checks afterwards that what is published
 * is still there and still the attested bytes. Both exist because the images
 * moved out of `examples/renders/` -- 117 MB of history for files no tool reads
 * -- while their provenance stayed behind. The 83 receipts in that directory are
 * the manifest: one per poster, each recording the sha256 of the exact PNG the
 * renderer emitted.
 *
 * Deliberately standalone rather than folded into `site/scripts/verify-assets.mjs`,
 * which reads `site/public/assets/index.json` and so cannot run until the whole
 * gallery build has succeeded. This check has no such precondition, and it is the
 * only place that can honestly assert an image exists: a local manifest would
 * only record that an upload once happened, and would pass while the bucket
 * returns 404.
 *
 * Existence is checked for every object. Hashes are checked wherever a receipt
 * exists, which is every poster but `tidal-observatory` -- an archive entry kept
 * for the docs that predates the receipts -- and none of the animations, since
 * GIFs are assembled from frames and were never attested individually.
