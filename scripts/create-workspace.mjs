const guide = `# Kiln asset workspace

Author and refine assets in this directory. The engine is installed separately. Do not read its implementation or example collection to solve an asset task.

Two surfaces drive the same engine and share .kiln/programs, so either is fine and you can mix them freely. The kiln_workspace MCP server returns each render as an image in your context. The node kiln.mjs CLI writes renders to disk, so read the PNG back before judging anything visual. A server named kiln may be a different installation; do not substitute it silently, and report the setup problem instead. To check, call kiln_discover with { capabilities: true } and compare capabilities.engine.installUrl against runtime in .kiln/workspace.json.

Read the skill for your task from skills/ in this directory, never a global plugin copy. The maintained copies are there, mirrored into .claude/skills/ and .agents/skills/ because harnesses scan different directories. Use kiln_discover with no arguments for a compact overview and starting createRoot/createPart signatures. Search in ordinary modeling language with { query: "curved hollow tube" }; fetch complete contracts with { ids: ["sweepProfile"] }. Search and overview return six summaries by default, with current family/kind/tags filters and offset/limit pagination. Exact ids accepts up to six distinct IDs or executable names. Recipes are optional guidance, and no asset-category selection or separate search model is required. CLI equivalents are node kiln.mjs discover --query "curved hollow tube" and node kiln.mjs discover --id sweepProfile --json.

Managed CLI/MCP startup checks runtime and copied-skill versions. If they differ, stop this session and run kiln-init on this directory with --check and --upgrade from the desired installation. Conflicting local edits require an explicit merge; do not overwrite them to clear a diagnostic. Restart the session after upgrading.

## The loop

1. Draft. Pass code once to kiln_render or kiln_validate, or import a file with node kiln.mjs source asset.kiln.js. Either returns a programRef, normally a short immutable p_ handle. Keep it even when validation fails. Copy it exactly; never construct, expand or shorten one, and do not retransmit the program.
2. Render. kiln_render, or node kiln.mjs render PROGRAM_REF --views sheet.png.
3. Review. Look at the image. Check viewFidelity before judging materials: a CPU view is honest about silhouette, proportion and contact, and says nothing about colour, metalness or roughness.
   For animation, use kiln_screenshot_animation or node kiln.mjs animation PROGRAM_REF --clip CLIP_NAME --phases 0,0.25,0.5,0.75,1 --views motion.png --json. Phases are fractions of clip duration. Add --render gpu for material review, read the PNG and check attachments in intermediate poses; do not replace clip sampling with source edits that bake a rest pose.
4. Edit. Read exact anchors with kiln_source and a literal query, following nextOffset for more context, then call kiln_edit with programRef and edits. Each edit returns a new programRef; use that one from then on. Rewriting the whole file through the CLI works, but it loses the anchored diff and the revision lineage.
5. Save. The user chooses a named destination; discover configured collections when needed and otherwise default to project. Use kiln_save, or node kiln.mjs save. Keep the exact asset and revision IDs. Save refinements as child revisions rather than replacing their parent. When the user wants to see the result, call kiln_present; if the host cannot render it, launch node kiln.mjs view yourself and provide its loopback URL.

Export at any point. Source is node kiln.mjs source PROGRAM_REF --out revised.kiln.js; geometry is node kiln.mjs render PROGRAM_REF --out asset.glb --views sheet.png. Source and ZIP exports refuse to overwrite a file. Render replaces existing GLB and PNG files only after each replacement is fully written and closed; a failed write or rename preserves the previous file. Replacement is per file, not a transaction across outputs. Replace PROGRAM_REF with the exact returned reference; full sha256 references also remain valid.

## Material-faithful views

This workspace asks for render mode auto. Textured or metallic scenes use a verified compatible GPU service, starting one lazily when local dependencies are available. Ordinary untextured scenes with zero metalness and no advanced material extensions use CPU geometry views; this does not indicate renderer failure. CPU views report viewFidelity.materialFaithful false and cannot confirm PBR appearance. Use CLI --render gpu when GPU material review is required, including roughness on nonmetallic surfaces.

The render-service code is included with Kiln, with its native GPU dependency optional at the Kiln package root. Check node kiln.mjs service status first. If dependencies are missing or incompatible, reinstall the official Kiln package with optional dependencies enabled; read runtime from .kiln/workspace.json to identify the installation. A source checkout uses bun install --frozen-lockfile at that root. CLI and MCP start the managed service when needed; compatible clients share it until five minutes pass without admitted work. From the installation root, node --import ./render-service/src/register-hooks.mjs render-service/src/server.mjs starts a manual service that remains running while idle. Unknown or incompatible listeners are reported and left in place.

After dependency repair or a cached startup failure, call kiln_renderer with {action:"reprobe"} in this MCP session. It refreshes the existing route without installing dependencies or starting a renderer; the next view starts one if needed. CLI service reprobe checks only its own process. Restart the session after changing Kiln, environment variables or credentials.

For a renderer on another device, configure this MCP server process with KILN_RENDER_PORT_URL and, when required, KILN_RENDER_TOKEN through the harness's environment settings. CLI commands accept --render-port URL and read KILN_RENDER_TOKEN. Run a compatible Kiln renderer on that device; a bind beyond loopback requires service-side RENDER_SERVICE_TOKEN unless an authenticated proxy is explicitly configured. A remote service is managed on its own device. Check capabilities for the selected route and an actual viewFidelity receipt for successful material rendering.

For a task about appearance, say so rather than silently accepting CPU views.

## Context compaction

Long-running and headless sessions may compact context automatically. Keep a small KILN_PROGRESS.md when the task spans many tool calls. Before a compaction boundary, or after each meaningful revision, record the active goal, current programRef, files changed, validation and render results, unresolved errors, and the exact next action. After compaction, read that note and continue; do not stop merely because the conversation was summarized. Never replace a programRef from memory -- copy the exact current value from the note or the latest tool result.

## Keep this context clean

Skills and MCP servers from user-level configuration still load here: a workspace separates task context, not operating-system permissions. When you verify the server, report anything registered that is unrelated to this task so the user can decide whether to narrow it.

Keep .kiln/programs while working. Source files are portable; references resolve only in a store containing their source.
