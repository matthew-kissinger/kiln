/**
 * The toolchain gate's own test.
 *
 * `check-toolchain.mjs` has grown three times -- the engine/CI pins, then the prose
 * every harness reads, then cross-manifest `three` parity -- and each extension was
 * verified by injecting the defect by hand, once, at the time. That is the right
 * check to make and the wrong place to keep it: nothing stops the NEXT edit from
 * leaving a rule that can no longer fail. A regex that quietly stops matching, or a
 * rule that reads the real repository instead of the tree it was handed, turns a gate
 * into decoration -- and a vacuous gate is worse than none, because it is believed.
 *
 * So every case here stages a real copy of the repository's own files, mutates exactly
 * one value, and asserts the gate names it. Staging the real files rather than a
 * synthetic fixture is deliberate: a rule whose phrasing drifts out of step with the
 * document it reads fails the baseline case immediately.
