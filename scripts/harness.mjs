 *
 * The skills go in `.claude/skills/`, which is the one location every harness
 * here agrees on -- Claude Code natively, and OpenCode which reads
 * `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` alongside its own `.opencode/skills`.
 * Antigravity loads them from its installed plugin copy instead, so for `agy`
 * this directory is belt and braces rather than the delivery mechanism.
 *
 * What this does NOT isolate, and it is worth being exact: skills and MCP
