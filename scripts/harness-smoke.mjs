// This exists because every wiring failure so far has been silent. A harness
// that cannot see the MCP server does not say so: `agy plugin validate` reports
// the server as processed while `agy mcp list` shows none, and the agent simply
// answers as if the tools were never mentioned. A harness that can see the
// tools but will not grant them behaves the same way -- three runs in one batch
// came back exit 0, having written a polite note about permissions instead of a
// program. Both look exactly like a model that was not up to the task.
//
// So this asks for the cheapest thing that cannot be faked: call one tool that
// only the server can answer, then write a four-line program and validate it.
// The parent then runs the engine over what came back, because the child's own
// report of success is the one piece of evidence that proves nothing.
//
// It costs one short model turn per harness. It is not part of `bun run test`
// and never should be -- it spends provider quota and needs CLIs that CI does
// not have.
