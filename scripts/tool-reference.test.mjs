/**
 * `docs/tools.md` is generated, and `docs/` is in the package's `files` list, so a
 * stale reference is published to every install. The generator has had a `--check`
 * mode from the start; it appeared in no workflow and no test, which is the same
 * shape as the render service's 37 tests running nowhere (13.7).
 *
 * What slipped through it: 13.2's in-range `zod` 4.4.3 -> 4.6.2 bump changed
 * `z.toJSONSchema` to emit `items: false`, `minItems` and `maxItems` for
 * fixed-length tuples, so every tuple input in the published reference understated
 * its own schema. An offline gate that exists but runs nowhere is worth exactly as
 * much as no gate.
